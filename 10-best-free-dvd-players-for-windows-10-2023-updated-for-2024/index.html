A growing number of laptop and desktop PCs no longer feature optical disc drives, while the discontinuation of the Windows Media Center marked the end of an era in which Windows OS offered a built-in DVD player.</p>
<p>The Windows 10 doesn’t have a native app that enables you to play movies or music from DVD and Blu-ray discs, and you must install a third-party DVD<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to view content from these sources.

<p>As it is now the second decade of the 21st century, data carriers like DVDs are slowly becoming obsolete. A growing number of laptop and desktop PCs no longer feature optical disc drives, while the discontinuation of the Windows Media Center marked the end of an era in which Windows OS offered a built-in DVD player.</p>
<p>The Windows 10 doesn’t have a native app that enables you to play movies or music from DVD and Blu-ray discs, and you must install a third-party DVD<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to view content from these sources.

<p><strong>●</strong> Keep it clutter-free: It’s always good to keep your thumbnail simple and clean without any clutter. If you use too many elements in a thumbnail, they will look messy when watched on a mobile device.</p>

It might be a possibility that the image automatically selected is good enough and effective and thus creating a customized thumbnail is not required.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Using editing software like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for creating customized graphics: A good editing software can be used for creating an effective and impressive image.
