<p>All iPhones and iPads offer a free way to edit all videos you record with them. All you need to do is make sure that iMovie is installed on your iPhone or iPad and you can start editing the footage you recorded. In addition, you can also import videos recorded with different types of cameras into iMovie, as long as they are saved in the file format that is compatible with this app.</p>
<p>iMovie offers a variety of predesigned trailer themes, so you just have to pick the one you like the most and then choose the footage you want to include in your trailer. Keep in mind that you cannot add music to any of the trailer themes, but you can export the trailer you created and create the soundtrack from iMovie’s Video mode. What’s more, you can also use this app to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >add transitions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, visual effects or <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >titles <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to the trailers you create with iMovie.</p>

The app lets you choose from hundreds of HD templates that can be customized quickly to meet the demands of your project. Moreover, you can create your own templates and use them on all future projects. Videos that are saved on the device’s camera roll can be easily imported into the app, which means that you can start making a new trailer just moments after recording the footage.</p>
<p>The trailers you create with the free version of Intro.Maker + 3D Movie Trailer are going to be watermarked and you must make an in-app purchase in order to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >remove the watermark <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

<p>Making a trailer or an intro for the videos you share online shouldn’t take too much of your time. This iPhone app offers an easy solution to all vloggers and video content creators who want to create trailers for their film projects from their phones. There are more than a thousand customizable templates to choose from, as well as over 700 motion stickers. In addition, the app doesn’t limit the number of titles you can add to a single project, and it lets you adjust the size, shadow and stroke values for each title you include in a video.</p>
<p>Even though the app doesn’t have a library of <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty-free songs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you can still use it to create soundtracks or even record voiceovers for your trailers. Moreover, the app’s file-sharing capabilities are underwhelming since you can only export videos to the camera roll. Purchasing the Intro Maker Premium or Premium Life Time subscription plans can be a good idea if you want to create new trailers and intros frequently.</p>

Simply choose a template that best fits the project you’re working on, import the footage from the camera roll, customize the template and export it from the app.</p>

If you are using iPhoto, you can sync it with IntroMate and import your trailers into Final Cut Pro or iMovie.

                ></p>
<p>Professional video editing tools or amazing video effects and filters are just a few reasons why this app is so popular among video content creators. Sadly, you cannot use this app to record video, but you can edit all videos stored in your iPhone’s or iPad’s camera roll.</p>
<p>The app’s library of filters and effects is frequently updated, which enables you to experiment with new visual styles almost every week. Adjusting brightness, saturation or contrast values requires a minimum amount of effort, which enables you to enhance the colors of the footage you include in your trailers. What’s more FX Special Effects for Videos also features a sound effect library and it also enables you to import music from your device’s memory card. The free version of the app watermarks all videos and you must make an in-app purchase if you want to remove it or gain access to bokeh, light leaks and other types of video filters.</p>

Is it really all that good? And, if it is, why? For the first part of this article, we’ve prepared a short overview on the AIFF file format You can skip ahead though if you’d prefer to see the tutorial on <strong>AIFF Converters</strong> or our list of recommendations.</p>
<h3 id="01What’s-AIFF"><a href="#01What’s-AIFF" class="headerlink" title="01What’s AIFF?"></a>01<strong>What’s AIFF?</strong></h3><p>AIFF, also called the Audio Interchange File Format, is an audio file format that was popularized in 1988. It was based on the Electronic Arts Interchange File Format and is probably most familiar for Mac users. It’s accepted by most media players, including Apple Music and the Apple QuickTime Player.</p>
<h3 id="02Why-Is-It-So-Popular"><a href="#02Why-Is-It-So-Popular" class="headerlink" title="02Why Is It So Popular?"></a>02<strong>Why Is It So Popular?</strong></h3><p>Why? Well, it all has to do with the loss of quality. AIFF files are notable because they are uncompressed — leading to an inarguably better sound. That makes it popular with content creators, who want to provide the best possible listening experience to their audience. The caveat to this, of course, is that its uncompressed state means that it takes up a lot more space on one’s disk drive. But, many people would be willing to give that up in exchange for the enhanced sound.</p>

This free audio converter is called ‘MediaHuman Audio Converter.’ It’s a really simple converter and is a great option for those who see themselves requiring an audio converter often but still don’t feel it necessary to cough up extra money for premium software when they can get a free one</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Add File(s) for Conversion</strong></p>
<p>First things first, upload the file that you want to convert With MediaHuman, you can do this in one of three ways:</p>

<p>Our next recommended tool is Convert on Mac This is another online tool that can be used to convert a variety of files (i.e., audio, video, image, document, etc). The one that we’ll be focusing on though is Convert on Mac’s <strong>AIFF Converter</strong></p>

<p>**<strong>3. Online Converter</strong></p>
<p>The next one up is Online Converter This one is more like ZAMZAR than Convert on Mac. If only because it also comes with a max file size that is locked. It’s more limited though — in that it doesn’t support as many input and output formats. And, as you can no doubt guess from the interface, quite old-school as well.</p>

<p>For this next <strong>AIFF Converter</strong>, we make a complete departure from your general converters by introducing a completely different beast altogether Specifically, in the form of a Video Editor called Filmora. Filmora is an incredibly advanced video editing tool. And, because of this, it’s capable of most things related to video and audio editing. Including, in this case, AIFF conversion</p>

<p>**<strong>5. EaseUS Video Converter</strong></p>
<p>With ‘EaseUS Video Converter’ we continue on our trend of AIFF conversion software This one, despite its name suggesting otherwise, functions as a solid Audio Converter So far, it’s closest to Filmora Pro when compared to all the others on this list. It’s a one-trick kind of pony though. Seeing as, unlike with Filmora, you can really only use this to convert files.</p>

<p>This next software, the ‘Wondershare UniConverter’ is a bit of a mix between Filmora and EaseUS Video Converter. As is evident from the UI (shown-off in the screenshot provided), it has the makings of a straightforward converter but with extra tools (i.e., video editor, video compressor, merger, screen recorder, etc.) that you can take advantage of while working on your conversions.</p>

It’s not the most efficient, but with iTunes’ AIFF Encoder, conversion to AIFF is possible (converting from AIFF to MP3, and WAV is also possible because iTunes provides Encoders for those as well).</p>

This is because AIFF, unlike the more general, MP3 file format, is not a compressed format.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are various ways that you can convert from and to the AIFF file format. The first method that we introduced was an online tool that would be available for use no matter what computer or device you’re using The second was chosen specifically because it was FREE and available for both Windows and Mac</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you’re interested in looking through other options, the ten other converters we introduced should provide a healthy lot for you to choose from — with various levels of usefulness depending on what you need an <strong>AIFF Converter.</strong></p>

Is it really all that good? And, if it is, why? For the first part of this article, we’ve prepared a short overview on the AIFF file format You can skip ahead though if you’d prefer to see the tutorial on <strong>AIFF Converters</strong> or our list of recommendations.</p>
<h3 id="01What’s-AIFF-1"><a href="#01What’s-AIFF-1" class="headerlink" title="01What’s AIFF?"></a>01<strong>What’s AIFF?</strong></h3><p>AIFF, also called the Audio Interchange File Format, is an audio file format that was popularized in 1988. It was based on the Electronic Arts Interchange File Format and is probably most familiar for Mac users. It’s accepted by most media players, including Apple Music and the Apple QuickTime Player.</p>
<h3 id="02Why-Is-It-So-Popular-1"><a href="#02Why-Is-It-So-Popular-1" class="headerlink" title="02Why Is It So Popular?"></a>02<strong>Why Is It So Popular?</strong></h3><p>Why? Well, it all has to do with the loss of quality. AIFF files are notable because they are uncompressed — leading to an inarguably better sound. That makes it popular with content creators, who want to provide the best possible listening experience to their audience. The caveat to this, of course, is that its uncompressed state means that it takes up a lot more space on one’s disk drive. But, many people would be willing to give that up in exchange for the enhanced sound.</p>

The benefit of using an online converter like the one we’ll be showing you how to use is that it is usually FREE and very efficient. This makes it a perfect solution for those who are just looking to convert to or from AIFF occasionally and thus has no need for a more permanent solution.</p>

For our example, we’ve chosen FreeConvert, but there are plenty of other ones out there for you to choose from</p>
<p>Once you’re on-site, make use of the upload options to prepare your file to be converted. In this case, we uploaded an MP3 file, but it will work for M4A to AIFF just as well (along with other file formats.)</p>

This free audio converter is called ‘MediaHuman Audio Converter.’ It’s a really simple converter and is a great option for those who see themselves requiring an audio converter often but still don’t feel it necessary to cough up extra money for premium software when they can get a free one</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Add File(s) for Conversion</strong></p>
<p>First things first, upload the file that you want to convert With MediaHuman, you can do this in one of three ways:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Drop media onto the specified area</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Click the “+” file option in order to manually add file</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Click the “+ folder” option in order to manually add files</p>

<p>Our next recommended tool is Convert on Mac This is another online tool that can be used to convert a variety of files (i.e., audio, video, image, document, etc). The one that we’ll be focusing on though is Convert on Mac’s <strong>AIFF Converter</strong></p>

<p>**<strong>3. Online Converter</strong></p>
<p>The next one up is Online Converter This one is more like ZAMZAR than Convert on Mac. If only because it also comes with a max file size that is locked. It’s more limited though — in that it doesn’t support as many input and output formats. And, as you can no doubt guess from the interface, quite old-school as well.</p>

<p>For this next <strong>AIFF Converter</strong>, we make a complete departure from your general converters by introducing a completely different beast altogether Specifically, in the form of a Video Editor called Filmora. Filmora is an incredibly advanced video editing tool. And, because of this, it’s capable of most things related to video and audio editing. Including, in this case, AIFF conversion</p>

<p>**<strong>5. EaseUS Video Converter</strong></p>
<p>With ‘EaseUS Video Converter’ we continue on our trend of AIFF conversion software This one, despite its name suggesting otherwise, functions as a solid Audio Converter So far, it’s closest to Filmora Pro when compared to all the others on this list. It’s a one-trick kind of pony though. Seeing as, unlike with Filmora, you can really only use this to convert files.</p>

<p>This next software, the ‘Wondershare UniConverter’ is a bit of a mix between Filmora and EaseUS Video Converter. As is evident from the UI (shown-off in the screenshot provided), it has the makings of a straightforward converter but with extra tools (i.e., video editor, video compressor, merger, screen recorder, etc.) that you can take advantage of while working on your conversions.</p>

It’s not the most efficient, but with iTunes’ AIFF Encoder, conversion to AIFF is possible (converting from AIFF to MP3, and WAV is also possible because iTunes provides Encoders for those as well).</p>

This is because AIFF, unlike the more general, MP3 file format, is not a compressed format.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are various ways that you can convert from and to the AIFF file format. The first method that we introduced was an online tool that would be available for use no matter what computer or device you’re using The second was chosen specifically because it was FREE and available for both Windows and Mac</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you’re interested in looking through other options, the ten other converters we introduced should provide a healthy lot for you to choose from — with various levels of usefulness depending on what you need an <strong>AIFF Converter.</strong></p>

Is it really all that good? And, if it is, why? For the first part of this article, we’ve prepared a short overview on the AIFF file format You can skip ahead though if you’d prefer to see the tutorial on <strong>AIFF Converters</strong> or our list of recommendations.</p>
<h3 id="01What’s-AIFF-2"><a href="#01What’s-AIFF-2" class="headerlink" title="01What’s AIFF?"></a>01<strong>What’s AIFF?</strong></h3><p>AIFF, also called the Audio Interchange File Format, is an audio file format that was popularized in 1988. It was based on the Electronic Arts Interchange File Format and is probably most familiar for Mac users. It’s accepted by most media players, including Apple Music and the Apple QuickTime Player.</p>
<h3 id="02Why-Is-It-So-Popular-2"><a href="#02Why-Is-It-So-Popular-2" class="headerlink" title="02Why Is It So Popular?"></a>02<strong>Why Is It So Popular?</strong></h3><p>Why? Well, it all has to do with the loss of quality. AIFF files are notable because they are uncompressed — leading to an inarguably better sound. That makes it popular with content creators, who want to provide the best possible listening experience to their audience. The caveat to this, of course, is that its uncompressed state means that it takes up a lot more space on one’s disk drive. But, many people would be willing to give that up in exchange for the enhanced sound.</p>

The benefit of using an online converter like the one we’ll be showing you how to use is that it is usually FREE and very efficient. This makes it a perfect solution for those who are just looking to convert to or from AIFF occasionally and thus has no need for a more permanent solution.</p>

For our example, we’ve chosen FreeConvert, but there are plenty of other ones out there for you to choose from</p>
<p>Once you’re on-site, make use of the upload options to prepare your file to be converted. In this case, we uploaded an MP3 file, but it will work for M4A to AIFF just as well (along with other file formats.)</p>

<p>**<strong>3. Online Converter</strong></p>
<p>The next one up is Online Converter This one is more like ZAMZAR than Convert on Mac. If only because it also comes with a max file size that is locked. It’s more limited though — in that it doesn’t support as many input and output formats. And, as you can no doubt guess from the interface, quite old-school as well.</p>

<p>For this next <strong>AIFF Converter</strong>, we make a complete departure from your general converters by introducing a completely different beast altogether Specifically, in the form of a Video Editor called Filmora. Filmora is an incredibly advanced video editing tool. And, because of this, it’s capable of most things related to video and audio editing. Including, in this case, AIFF conversion</p>

<p>**<strong>5. EaseUS Video Converter</strong></p>
<p>With ‘EaseUS Video Converter’ we continue on our trend of AIFF conversion software This one, despite its name suggesting otherwise, functions as a solid Audio Converter So far, it’s closest to Filmora Pro when compared to all the others on this list. It’s a one-trick kind of pony though. Seeing as, unlike with Filmora, you can really only use this to convert files.</p>

<p>This next software, the ‘Wondershare UniConverter’ is a bit of a mix between Filmora and EaseUS Video Converter. As is evident from the UI (shown-off in the screenshot provided), it has the makings of a straightforward converter but with extra tools (i.e., video editor, video compressor, merger, screen recorder, etc.) that you can take advantage of while working on your conversions.</p>

This is because AIFF, unlike the more general, MP3 file format, is not a compressed format.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are various ways that you can convert from and to the AIFF file format. The first method that we introduced was an online tool that would be available for use no matter what computer or device you’re using The second was chosen specifically because it was FREE and available for both Windows and Mac</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you’re interested in looking through other options, the ten other converters we introduced should provide a healthy lot for you to choose from — with various levels of usefulness depending on what you need an <strong>AIFF Converter.</strong></p>

Is it really all that good? And, if it is, why? For the first part of this article, we’ve prepared a short overview on the AIFF file format You can skip ahead though if you’d prefer to see the tutorial on <strong>AIFF Converters</strong> or our list of recommendations.</p>
<h3 id="01What’s-AIFF-3"><a href="#01What’s-AIFF-3" class="headerlink" title="01What’s AIFF?"></a>01<strong>What’s AIFF?</strong></h3><p>AIFF, also called the Audio Interchange File Format, is an audio file format that was popularized in 1988. It was based on the Electronic Arts Interchange File Format and is probably most familiar for Mac users. It’s accepted by most media players, including Apple Music and the Apple QuickTime Player.</p>
<h3 id="02Why-Is-It-So-Popular-3"><a href="#02Why-Is-It-So-Popular-3" class="headerlink" title="02Why Is It So Popular?"></a>02<strong>Why Is It So Popular?</strong></h3><p>Why? Well, it all has to do with the loss of quality. AIFF files are notable because they are uncompressed — leading to an inarguably better sound. That makes it popular with content creators, who want to provide the best possible listening experience to their audience. The caveat to this, of course, is that its uncompressed state means that it takes up a lot more space on one’s disk drive. But, many people would be willing to give that up in exchange for the enhanced sound.</p>

The benefit of using an online converter like the one we’ll be showing you how to use is that it is usually FREE and very efficient. This makes it a perfect solution for those who are just looking to convert to or from AIFF occasionally and thus has no need for a more permanent solution.</p>

For our example, we’ve chosen FreeConvert, but there are plenty of other ones out there for you to choose from</p>
<p>Once you’re on-site, make use of the upload options to prepare your file to be converted. In this case, we uploaded an MP3 file, but it will work for M4A to AIFF just as well (along with other file formats.)</p>

<p>**<strong>3. Online Converter</strong></p>
<p>The next one up is Online Converter This one is more like ZAMZAR than Convert on Mac. If only because it also comes with a max file size that is locked. It’s more limited though — in that it doesn’t support as many input and output formats. And, as you can no doubt guess from the interface, quite old-school as well.</p>

<p>For this next <strong>AIFF Converter</strong>, we make a complete departure from your general converters by introducing a completely different beast altogether Specifically, in the form of a Video Editor called Filmora. Filmora is an incredibly advanced video editing tool. And, because of this, it’s capable of most things related to video and audio editing. Including, in this case, AIFF conversion</p>

<p>With ‘EaseUS Video Converter’ we continue on our trend of AIFF conversion software This one, despite its name suggesting otherwise, functions as a solid Audio Converter So far, it’s closest to Filmora Pro when compared to all the others on this list. It’s a one-trick kind of pony though. Seeing as, unlike with Filmora, you can really only use this to convert files.</p>

<p>This next software, the ‘Wondershare UniConverter’ is a bit of a mix between Filmora and EaseUS Video Converter. As is evident from the UI (shown-off in the screenshot provided), it has the makings of a straightforward converter but with extra tools (i.e., video editor, video compressor, merger, screen recorder, etc.) that you can take advantage of while working on your conversions.</p>

This is because AIFF, unlike the more general, MP3 file format, is not a compressed format.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are various ways that you can convert from and to the AIFF file format. The first method that we introduced was an online tool that would be available for use no matter what computer or device you’re using The second was chosen specifically because it was FREE and available for both Windows and Mac</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you’re interested in looking through other options, the ten other converters we introduced should provide a healthy lot for you to choose from — with various levels of usefulness depending on what you need an <strong>AIFF Converter.</strong></p>

Optionally, you can also add text layers to your videos, use motion effects to simulate camera movement, or use some available 3D filters.

<p>Moreover, Shotcut has all the tools you’re going to need in order to fine-tune the colors in each clip you want to include in the final cut of your video. The software’s audio editing capabilities are equally impressive, you can easily fade in and fade out audio files, control their volume or apply filters to them. The best part is that Shotcut doesn’t have demanding system requirements, so you can use it on computers that don’t have a lot of processing power or powerful graphics cards.</p>

<h2 id="Aspects-You-Need-to-Consider-while-Choosing-the-iMovie-Replacement-for-Windows-10-3"><a href="#Aspects-You-Need-to-Consider-while-Choosing-the-iMovie-Replacement-for-Windows-10-3" class="headerlink" title="Aspects You Need to Consider while Choosing the iMovie Replacement for Windows 10"></a>Aspects You Need to Consider while Choosing the iMovie Replacement for Windows 10</h2><p>Determining which video editing app for Windows 10 you should choose is going to be much easier if you already know which types of videos you want to create. Moreover, the editor you choose has to offer support for the file format or the resolution in which the video was captured. Here are some of the most important factors you need to consider before installing a new video editor on your computer.</p>
<h3 id="1-4K-Video-Editing-Support-3"><a href="#1-4K-Video-Editing-Support-3" class="headerlink" title="1. 4K Video Editing Support"></a>1. 4K Video Editing Support</h3><p>Recording videos in 4K resolution has become more popular in recent years, as Smartphones and action cameras started offering this option. So if you are recording 4K videos often, you need video editing software that enables you to edit the videos recorded in this resolution. Moreover, you need to make sure that the video editing app you’re interested in allows you to export projects in 4K resolution.</p>
<h3 id="2-Cross-device-Capability-3"><a href="#2-Cross-device-Capability-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Cross-device Capability"></a>2. Cross-device Capability</h3><p>Social media content creators often want to share their videos just moments after recording it. So, if you are often creating videos you share on social media, you should choose a video editor that is also compatible with iPhones and Android devices. Having the option to edit videos from both your Smartphone and your computer will make it much easier to share fresh content on social media.</p>
<h3 id="3-Built-in-Features-Resource-3"><a href="#3-Built-in-Features-Resource-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Built-in Features &amp; Resource"></a>3. Built-in Features &amp; Resource</h3><p>The number of video editing tools, the sizes of audio and video effects libraries, or how many transitions a video editing software offers are all the factors you need to consider before you opt for one option or the other. On the other hand, getting a video editing app for Windows 10 that offers advanced video editing tools is only a good option if you are planning to learn how to use these tools.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Even though Windows 10 no longer has an iMovie equivalent, it is still relatively easy to find a video editing app for Windows 10 you can use to edit your footage quickly before sharing it with your friends on social media.</p>
<p>You don’t need to have a ton of video editing experience in order to create videos with video editors like Filmora or Adobe Rush. Which iMovie replacement are you going to choose? Leave a comment and let us know.</p>
