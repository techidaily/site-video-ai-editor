<p>The effect that comes up after adding two or more screens in a single frame is called split screen, and the tool that enables the users to do this is a <strong>split screen video editor</strong>. These split screens have significant importance in post-production tasks. That said, the following sections discuss about the tools that enable you to create split screen videos, and explain the process of doing so.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the split screen effect lets you add two or more screens in a single frame. When multiple activities occur at the same time but at different locations, they all can be shown on one screen by placing their corresponding footages side-by-side or in any other arrangement that the <strong>split screen video maker</strong> allows.</p>

Some of the most common uses include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Showing multiple actions by the same or different characters at the same time, without changing the screen</li>
<li>Comparing multiple objects or picture quality. This can be done only when the entities in question are placed side-by-side</li>
<li>Making your video look more professional</li>
<li>Showing different effects on the same screen</li>

However, as discussed above, there are several post-production tools, offline and online, that allow you to make split screen videos easily and without any cost.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Split screen video editor</strong></a> tools are both paid and free. Regardless of the program you use to create the effect, the output files always look more professional and informative.
