<p>In historic terms, cinema is still a relatively new art, and yet the amount of footage that has been filmed since the Lumière brothers released their first film is staggering. Capturing unique materials that were never seen by the world before has become the question of prestige among the filmmakers. Nonetheless, certain genres of film are almost entirely dependent on the public domain footage. Documentaries about historic events, space or any other topic that is impossible to stage rely on the videos that entered the public domain for one reason or the other. That’s why in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best websites that let you download public domain videos.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Public-Domain-Video"><a href="#What-is-Public-Domain-Video" class="headerlink" title="What is Public Domain Video?"></a>What is Public Domain Video?</h2><p>Any video that is not subject to copyright can be considered a public domain video. This means that anyone can use this footage for free without having to ask for permission to do so. Videos can enter the public domain under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the footage was produced by a government because governments are obligated by the law to offer the footage to the public domain.</li>
<li>In case the author of the footage has forfeited his or her copyrights and dedicated the footage to the public domain</li>
<li>A film or any other work of art becomes public domain 70 years after the death of the copyright holder. The expiration date of the copyrights is not the same in all the countries around the world, which is why you must make sure that the video you want to use is, in fact, a public domain video.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you should avoid using the footage that contains art or music that can be described as third-party intellectual property because you may unintentionally infringe copyrights.</p>

<p>Industry professionals don’t need an introduction to the Pond5 platform, because it is probably the largest online marketplace for royalty-free media at the moment. Their Public Domain Project contains a thousand public videos that can be downloaded for free, but the duration of these videos is limited to just two minutes To make things worse, most of these public domain videos don’t have audio, so you can only use them if you already have a soundtrack for the video you’re making. The platform offers powerful search tools that enable you to look for videos based on different parameters. You can download public domain videos in HD resolution, but you must create an account on Pond5 before you can save them to your computer.</p>

<p>In historic terms, cinema is still a relatively new art, and yet the amount of footage that has been filmed since the Lumière brothers released their first film is staggering. Capturing unique materials that were never seen by the world before has become the question of prestige among the filmmakers. Nonetheless, certain genres of film are almost entirely dependent on the public domain footage. Documentaries about historic events, space or any other topic that is impossible to stage rely on the videos that entered the public domain for one reason or the other. That’s why in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best websites that let you download public domain videos.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Public-Domain-Video-1"><a href="#What-is-Public-Domain-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="What is Public Domain Video?"></a>What is Public Domain Video?</h2><p>Any video that is not subject to copyright can be considered a public domain video. This means that anyone can use this footage for free without having to ask for permission to do so. Videos can enter the public domain under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the footage was produced by a government because governments are obligated by the law to offer the footage to the public domain.</li>
<li>In case the author of the footage has forfeited his or her copyrights and dedicated the footage to the public domain</li>
<li>A film or any other work of art becomes public domain 70 years after the death of the copyright holder. The expiration date of the copyrights is not the same in all the countries around the world, which is why you must make sure that the video you want to use is, in fact, a public domain video.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you should avoid using the footage that contains art or music that can be described as third-party intellectual property because you may unintentionally infringe copyrights.</p>

Over the course of the last couple of decades, the websites where you can <strong>download public domain footage</strong> have grown in number, which makes it somewhat easier to find the video clips you can use in your projects for free. Here are some of the best online destinations where you can <strong>download public domain videos</strong>.</p>

<p>This is an excellent resource for researchers looking for essays, books, audio recordings, images or old films. The movies are divided into different categories such as Animals&amp;Beasts, Politics, War or Sports which makes locating and <strong>downloading public domain videos</strong> faster and easier. The Public Domain Review offers footage that is available within different public domain licenses, so you must make sure that the film you want to download can be used for the purpose you have in mind. The vast majority of the films in this archive are from the last decade of the 19th and the first half of the 20th century. That’s why The Public Domain Review’s selection of films can only be useful if you are researching a topic from that era.</p>

Respecting the terms of the license under which a video is protected is of utmost importance, since failing to properly credit the author of the video, for instance, can have legal consequences.

<p>Public domain videos cover very different topics, which means that the nature of your project determines the source from which you’ll acquire the footage. If you are researching the early days of cinema, then you’ll have no trouble downloading the public domain videos, but if the topic you’re exploring is more contemporary, finding the content you can use without any restrictions can prove to be troublesome.

<p>In historic terms, cinema is still a relatively new art, and yet the amount of footage that has been filmed since the Lumière brothers released their first film is staggering. Capturing unique materials that were never seen by the world before has become the question of prestige among the filmmakers. Nonetheless, certain genres of film are almost entirely dependent on the public domain footage. Documentaries about historic events, space or any other topic that is impossible to stage rely on the videos that entered the public domain for one reason or the other. That’s why in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best websites that let you download public domain videos.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Public-Domain-Video-2"><a href="#What-is-Public-Domain-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="What is Public Domain Video?"></a>What is Public Domain Video?</h2><p>Any video that is not subject to copyright can be considered a public domain video. This means that anyone can use this footage for free without having to ask for permission to do so. Videos can enter the public domain under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the footage was produced by a government because governments are obligated by the law to offer the footage to the public domain.</li>
<li>In case the author of the footage has forfeited his or her copyrights and dedicated the footage to the public domain</li>
<li>A film or any other work of art becomes public domain 70 years after the death of the copyright holder. The expiration date of the copyrights is not the same in all the countries around the world, which is why you must make sure that the video you want to use is, in fact, a public domain video.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you should avoid using the footage that contains art or music that can be described as third-party intellectual property because you may unintentionally infringe copyrights.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Online-Websites-Where-You-Can-Download-Public-Domain-Videos-2"><a href="#Best-Online-Websites-Where-You-Can-Download-Public-Domain-Videos-2" class="headerlink" title="Best Online Websites Where You Can Download Public Domain Videos"></a>Best Online Websites Where You Can Download Public Domain Videos</h2><p><strong>Finding free public domain footage or public movies</strong> on the Internet has never been too difficult, as you can watch thousands of public domain movies on YouTube, but you cannot download them. Over the course of the last couple of decades, the websites where you can <strong>download public domain footage</strong> have grown in number, which makes it somewhat easier to find the video clips you can use in your projects for free. Here are some of the best online destinations where you can <strong>download public domain videos</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="1-Prelinger-Archive-2"><a href="#1-Prelinger-Archive-2" class="headerlink" title="1.

                      alt="Public Domain Video Download "
                ></p>
<p>With more than 17,000 items in the collection, the Prelinger Archive is probably one of the largest public domain video libraries on the Internet. The archive was founded in 1983 by Rick Prelinger, but by 2002 it became a part of the Library of Congress Motion Picture Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Divison’s collection. You can <strong>download public domain video clips</strong> created by educational institutions, advertising companies, trade associations or corporations from this impressive collection. There are different download options available for each file, so you can choose the size of a file and the method you’re going to use to download a file to your computer.</p>

                ></p>
<p>This is an excellent resource for researchers looking for essays, books, audio recordings, images or old films. The movies are divided into different categories such as Animals&amp;Beasts, Politics, War or Sports which makes locating and <strong>downloading public domain videos</strong> faster and easier. The Public Domain Review offers footage that is available within different public domain licenses, so you must make sure that the film you want to download can be used for the purpose you have in mind. The vast majority of the films in this archive are from the last decade of the 19th and the first half of the 20th century. That’s why The Public Domain Review’s selection of films can only be useful if you are researching a topic from that era.</p>
<h4 id="3-The-National-Screening-Room-2"><a href="#3-The-National-Screening-Room-2" class="headerlink" title="3.

                ></p>
<p>The National Screening Room is a project created by the Library of Congress National Audio-Visual Conservation Center with the aim of making the videos from their collection available to the viewers around the world. The vast majority of the videos in the collection were filmed during the 20th century, but there are only a few videos available that are produced outside of the United States. The National Screening Room can be a valuable asset if you are looking for videos you can use for educational or research videos that cover topics that range from the development of the arms industry to the daily life of great American inventors.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Industry professionals don’t need an introduction to the Pond5 platform, because it is probably the largest online marketplace for royalty-free media at the moment. Their Public Domain Project contains a thousand public videos that can be downloaded for free, but the duration of these videos is limited to just two minutes To make things worse, most of these public domain videos don’t have audio, so you can only use them if you already have a soundtrack for the video you’re making. The platform offers powerful search tools that enable you to look for videos based on different parameters. You can download public domain videos in HD resolution, but you must create an account on Pond5 before you can save them to your computer.</p>
<h4 id="5-Pexels-2"><a href="#5-Pexels-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Pexels"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pexels.com/search/videos/public%20domain/" >Pexels <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

<p><strong>Free public domain stock footage</strong> can be used on different types of projects, and it is usually a great choice if you’re looking for some extra shots that will make a scene in your video more cinematic. Pexels offers an impressive collection of free public domain stock videos, so you just have to insert a search term and pick a video clip that best fits your needs. The duration of the free videos you can find on Pexels rarely exceeds thirty seconds, which makes it difficult to make an entire video exclusively from free public domain stock footage. Hence it is better to use Pexels as a complementary source of shots in case you can’t go back to the filming location.</p>
<h4 id="6-Vidsplay-2"><a href="#6-Vidsplay-2" class="headerlink" title="6. Vidsplay"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vidsplay.com/" >Vidsplay <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>All video clips you can find on this platform are free, so you just have to select one of the categories and start browsing through the available public domain stock footage. The only condition to use the stock footage on private or commercial projects for free is to credit the Vidsplay platform in the end credits, on the website or in the description of the videos you upload to your social media channels. All stock videos on Vidsplay are available in HD or 4K resolution, and you simply have to click on the Download button below a particular video to save it.</p>

Within the Moving Image Archive, you can find different collections that contain full feature movies, art videos, animations, cartoons or television footage. The public domain videos hosted on The Moving Image Archive cover a broad range of topics, but some of them can be in poor resolution. The Moving Image Archive can be an excellent source of footage for anyone who wants to download <strong>public domain video clips</strong> and use them in their commercial or non-commercial projects.</p>
<h4 id="8-PublicDomainFootage-2"><a href="#8-PublicDomainFootage-2" class="headerlink" title="8.

You can also use PublicDomainFootage to research a particular topic and request content that is not uploaded to the website. You can <strong>download a public domain video</strong> after you pay a one time fee that enables you to use that video as many times as you want. The platform’s YouTube channel provides an easy way of searching for public domain videos you are going to use in your next documentary film.</p>
<h4 id="9-NASA’s-Video-Gallery-2"><a href="#9-NASA’s-Video-Gallery-2" class="headerlink" title="9.

Like all other government institutions, NASA is obligated by the law to offer all images and videos to the public domain. This means that all content you download from their website is free to use. Simply insert the search term and browse the results until you find the video clip you want to save to your computer. However, most public domain videos you can download from NASA’s website last only a couple of minutes.</p>

Over the course of the last couple of decades, the websites where you can <strong>download public domain footage</strong> have grown in number, which makes it somewhat easier to find the video clips you can use in your projects for free. Here are some of the best online destinations where you can <strong>download public domain videos</strong>.</p>

<p>With more than 17,000 items in the collection, the Prelinger Archive is probably one of the largest public domain video libraries on the Internet. The archive was founded in 1983 by Rick Prelinger, but by 2002 it became a part of the Library of Congress Motion Picture Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Divison’s collection. You can <strong>download public domain video clips</strong> created by educational institutions, advertising companies, trade associations or corporations from this impressive collection. There are different download options available for each file, so you can choose the size of a file and the method you’re going to use to download a file to your computer.</p>

<p>This is an excellent resource for researchers looking for essays, books, audio recordings, images or old films. The movies are divided into different categories such as Animals&amp;Beasts, Politics, War or Sports which makes locating and <strong>downloading public domain videos</strong> faster and easier. The Public Domain Review offers footage that is available within different public domain licenses, so you must make sure that the film you want to download can be used for the purpose you have in mind. The vast majority of the films in this archive are from the last decade of the 19th and the first half of the 20th century. That’s why The Public Domain Review’s selection of films can only be useful if you are researching a topic from that era.</p>

<p>The National Screening Room is a project created by the Library of Congress National Audio-Visual Conservation Center with the aim of making the videos from their collection available to the viewers around the world. The vast majority of the videos in the collection were filmed during the 20th century, but there are only a few videos available that are produced outside of the United States. The National Screening Room can be a valuable asset if you are looking for videos you can use for educational or research videos that cover topics that range from the development of the arms industry to the daily life of great American inventors.</p>

<p>Industry professionals don’t need an introduction to the Pond5 platform, because it is probably the largest online marketplace for royalty-free media at the moment. Their Public Domain Project contains a thousand public videos that can be downloaded for free, but the duration of these videos is limited to just two minutes To make things worse, most of these public domain videos don’t have audio, so you can only use them if you already have a soundtrack for the video you’re making. The platform offers powerful search tools that enable you to look for videos based on different parameters. You can download public domain videos in HD resolution, but you must create an account on Pond5 before you can save them to your computer.</p>

<p><strong>Free public domain stock footage</strong> can be used on different types of projects, and it is usually a great choice if you’re looking for some extra shots that will make a scene in your video more cinematic. Pexels offers an impressive collection of free public domain stock videos, so you just have to insert a search term and pick a video clip that best fits your needs. The duration of the free videos you can find on Pexels rarely exceeds thirty seconds, which makes it difficult to make an entire video exclusively from free public domain stock footage. Hence it is better to use Pexels as a complementary source of shots in case you can’t go back to the filming location.</p>

Like all other government institutions, NASA is obligated by the law to offer all images and videos to the public domain. This means that all content you download from their website is free to use.

In addition, the platform doesn’t allow you to make more than five downloads per week and you must invite your friends to join the platform if you want to increase the weekly number of downloads. Even so, Motion Elements is a great source of stock footage you can use without any restrictions.</p>

Crediting the author or providing the source from which you acquired the footage will reduce the likelihood of legal complications. The public domain videos that feature famous actors or third party intellectual property can also be a subject of legal disputes, which is why it is better to avoid using them on commercial projects.</p>

Respecting the terms of the license under which a video is protected is of utmost importance, since failing to properly credit the author of the video, for instance, can have legal consequences. There are several different types of Creative Commons licenses and you must find out which one covers the video you’d like to use, before publishing your video. You can find more information about Creative Commons licenses at the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/" >FAQ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Public domain videos cover very different topics, which means that the nature of your project determines the source from which you’ll acquire the footage. If you are researching the early days of cinema, then you’ll have no trouble downloading the public domain videos, but if the topic you’re exploring is more contemporary, finding the content you can use without any restrictions can prove to be troublesome.

<p>If you’re looking, specifically, for a clean method of doing so, then it’s understandable if you’re facing difficulty with finding the right one. There are many <strong>speech-to-text</strong> audio converters available.</p>

The quick answer? Yes</p>
<p>Transcribe (shown in the image below), which is available for all iOS devices, is one such app. This tool, as you might be able to guess from the name, is able to transcribe spoken audio into text. It’s especially useful for creating notes (personal use), as it means you can have your thoughts written down in an instant without ever having to lift up a pen or type it down for yourself.</p>
<p>And, just to be very clear, there are many more <strong>speech-to-text</strong> apps like this one</p>

<p>If you’re looking, specifically, for a clean method of doing so, then it’s understandable if you’re facing difficulty with finding the right one. There are many <strong>speech-to-text</strong> audio converters available.</p>

The quick answer? Yes</p>
<p>Transcribe (shown in the image below), which is available for all iOS devices, is one such app. This tool, as you might be able to guess from the name, is able to transcribe spoken audio into text. It’s especially useful for creating notes (personal use), as it means you can have your thoughts written down in an instant without ever having to lift up a pen or type it down for yourself.</p>
<p>And, just to be very clear, there are many more <strong>speech-to-text</strong> apps like this one</p>

Or rather, a live transcriber tool, but it can be useful despite the fact, especially since, once again, it is 100% free and FREE to use. What we’re talking about, in this case, is Windows Dictate. This is a built-in function for Windows OS users. It’s there to increase accessibility for those with vision impairment, but it’s also a great way of easily converting your <strong>speech to text</strong>.</p>

<p>If you’re looking, specifically, for a clean method of doing so, then it’s understandable if you’re facing difficulty with finding the right one. There are many <strong>speech-to-text</strong> audio converters available.</p>
<p>However, not all of them are all that great in quality. In this article, we’ll be introducing a couple of converters that you can use to change <strong>audio to text</strong> as well as show you how to do it</p>

The quick answer? Yes</p>
<p>Transcribe (shown in the image below), which is available for all iOS devices, is one such app. This tool, as you might be able to guess from the name, is able to transcribe spoken audio into text. It’s especially useful for creating notes (personal use), as it means you can have your thoughts written down in an instant without ever having to lift up a pen or type it down for yourself.</p>
<p>And, just to be very clear, there are many more <strong>speech-to-text</strong> apps like this one</p>

From apps, software, online solutions, etc. There are plenty of ways, so you can find the one that works best for you</p>
<h3 id="01Online-Speech-to-Text-—-VEED-IO-3"><a href="#01Online-Speech-to-Text-—-VEED-IO-3" class="headerlink" title="01Online Speech-to-Text — VEED.IO"></a>01Online Speech-to-Text — VEED.IO</h3><p>The first and most common way to turn <strong>speech-to-text</strong>—especially for those who want something more accessible no matter what device they are on—is online <strong>speech-to-text MP3</strong> converters A great example of one of these online tools is the MP3 to text converter, VEED-IO. The key feature here is that you won’t have to download or install anything to start using it Also, VEED.IO (and many other online <strong>speech-to-text</strong> converters) is FREE.</p>

<h3 id="02Windows-Dictate-3"><a href="#02Windows-Dictate-3" class="headerlink" title="02Windows Dictate"></a>02Windows Dictate</h3><p>This next one is more of a live <strong>audio-to-text</strong> tool. Or rather, a live transcriber tool, but it can be useful despite the fact, especially since, once again, it is 100% free and FREE to use. What we’re talking about, in this case, is Windows Dictate. This is a built-in function for Windows OS users. It’s there to increase accessibility for those with vision impairment, but it’s also a great way of easily converting your <strong>speech to text</strong>.</p>

Another notable one, besides the app ‘Transcribe’ that we introduced earlier, is the iOS app called ‘Voice to Text Pro - Transcribe.’ This particular app offers advanced <strong>speech-to-text</strong> functionalities that will allow you to either transcribe live audio or upload an MP3 to transcribe. It also has support for over 150+ languages and has a convenient notes function for taking advantage of the transcription function.</p>

<h3 id="04Google-Docs-3"><a href="#04Google-Docs-3" class="headerlink" title="04Google Docs"></a>04Google Docs</h3><p>Another 100% FREE method of getting live <strong>speech</strong> <strong>to text</strong> is Google Doc’s “Voice Typing” function. You can turn this on at any time by making use of the command ‘Ctrl+Shift+S’ or by turning it on manually from the ‘Tools’ tab on a Google Document (shown in the image below). It’s a very easy way of getting your thoughts onto paper while working on other things.</p>

But, don’t worry, Windows Dictates has a Mac&#x2F;iOS counterpart It’s in the form of Apple Dictation Again, it was set up to increase accessibility for users with visual impairment, but it can be pretty useful as well for the times when your hands are too busy to actively type your thoughts down.</p>
<p>You can turn on this feature by going to your device’s ‘Accessibility’ settings and enabling ‘Voice Control’ (as is shown in the image below). It will need to be downloaded and installed onto your device, but it should begin working pretty quickly after that.</p>

And is perfect for transcribing live audio for a more professional setting.</p>

<h3 id="03Dragon-Anywhere-3"><a href="#03Dragon-Anywhere-3" class="headerlink" title="03Dragon Anywhere"></a>03Dragon Anywhere</h3><p>When people talk about advanced transcription methods, the first one to come is usually “Dragon Anywhere.” Again, much like Watson, this is a business solution that is often found in more professional settings. Also, it comes in a software version (for desktops and laptops) and an app version (for tablets and smart devices). The price of this particular piece of software is high, but there’s no denying that it produces high-quality <strong>speech-to-text</strong></p>

<p>There are many choices of software for video editing, but there is one that has been dominating the market for years – this is Final Cut Pro. Final Cut Pro, which was created by Apple, and took on a completely different path from other professional software.</p>
<p>The unique thing about Final Cut Pro is that it allows you to create video files easily and even edit them on the Mac using Final Cut Pro software alone, without any outside help. Before buying Final cut pro, you may want to have a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >90-day free trial of FCPX. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>The Mac App Store has made editing software more affordable. When Apple first acquired the Final Cut, it sold for $2,500, but now you can get a full version of the program from their store for only a cent shy of $300—an incredible deal.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?"></a><strong>Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?</strong></h2><p>The Pro Apps Bundle includes five industry-leading professional software from Apple. These powerful creative tools are best for musicians, video editors, and anyone looking to create the best content.</p>
<p>Plus, this bundle is also available to students, educators, faculty members at colleges or universities, and employees of any K-12 school district. Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education includes Final Cut Pro, Logic Studio, Motion, MainStage, and Compressor.</p>

                      alt="pro-apps"
                ></p>
<p> Apple has set pricing for its Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99. The bundle includes full versions of each software. There’s no time limit to ownership, and it doesn’t ask for a subscription or membership fee, unlike other subscription-based tools and software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Adobe Photoshop.</p>
<p>Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99 is totally worth getting if you plan to use Final Cut Pro and want Logic Studio and Mainstage 3 for free. If you’re thinking about purchasing Final Cut Pro or Logic Studio separately, be prepared to pay $299.99 and $199.99, respectively. MainStage is more affordable at $29.99. Motion and Compressor aren’t sold separately as they come bundled with Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>So, exactly how much are you saving here?</strong></p>
<p>If you need Final Cut Pro for work, we suggest you buy Pro Apps Bundle for Education, as you’ll be saving $100. You’ll also get Logic Pro and Mainstage for free. In total, you’ll be saving <strong>$330</strong>—an unbeatable deal if you ask me. I don’t anyone offers that kind of deal.</p>
<p>If you’re a musician or composer and have no use for Final Cut Pro, you can buy Logic Studio for $199.99—that’s your decision. But, you need to purchase Mainstage for $29.99, in case you need it. Nonetheless, we still recommend you get the Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99.</p>

<p>There are many choices of software for video editing, but there is one that has been dominating the market for years – this is Final Cut Pro. Final Cut Pro, which was created by Apple, and took on a completely different path from other professional software.</p>
<p>The unique thing about Final Cut Pro is that it allows you to create video files easily and even edit them on the Mac using Final Cut Pro software alone, without any outside help. Before buying Final cut pro, you may want to have a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >90-day free trial of FCPX. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>The Mac App Store has made editing software more affordable. When Apple first acquired the Final Cut, it sold for $2,500, but now you can get a full version of the program from their store for only a cent shy of $300—an incredible deal.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?"></a><strong>Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?</strong></h2><p>The Pro Apps Bundle includes five industry-leading professional software from Apple. These powerful creative tools are best for musicians, video editors, and anyone looking to create the best content.</p>
<p>Plus, this bundle is also available to students, educators, faculty members at colleges or universities, and employees of any K-12 school district. Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education includes Final Cut Pro, Logic Studio, Motion, MainStage, and Compressor.</p>

<p> Apple has set pricing for its Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99. The bundle includes full versions of each software. There’s no time limit to ownership, and it doesn’t ask for a subscription or membership fee, unlike other subscription-based tools and software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Adobe Photoshop.</p>
<p>Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99 is totally worth getting if you plan to use Final Cut Pro and want Logic Studio and Mainstage 3 for free. If you’re thinking about purchasing Final Cut Pro or Logic Studio separately, be prepared to pay $299.99 and $199.99, respectively. MainStage is more affordable at $29.99. Motion and Compressor aren’t sold separately as they come bundled with Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>So, exactly how much are you saving here?</strong></p>
<p>If you need Final Cut Pro for work, we suggest you buy Pro Apps Bundle for Education, as you’ll be saving $100. You’ll also get Logic Pro and Mainstage for free. In total, you’ll be saving <strong>$330</strong>—an unbeatable deal if you ask me. I don’t anyone offers that kind of deal.</p>
<p>If you’re a musician or composer and have no use for Final Cut Pro, you can buy Logic Studio for $199.99—that’s your decision. But, you need to purchase Mainstage for $29.99, in case you need it. Nonetheless, we still recommend you get the Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99.</p>
<p>For beginners who don’t actually need those many apps can always go with a <strong>cheaper yet maybe better editor, Filmora</strong>. Click and have a try!</p>

<p><strong>So, exactly how much are you saving here?</strong></p>
<p>If you need Final Cut Pro for work, we suggest you buy Pro Apps Bundle for Education, as you’ll be saving $100. You’ll also get Logic Pro and Mainstage for free. In total, you’ll be saving <strong>$330</strong>—an unbeatable deal if you ask me. I don’t anyone offers that kind of deal.</p>
<p>If you’re a musician or composer and have no use for Final Cut Pro, you can buy Logic Studio for $199.99—that’s your decision. But, you need to purchase Mainstage for $29.99, in case you need it. Nonetheless, we still recommend you get the Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99.</p>
<p>For beginners who don’t actually need those many apps can always go with a <strong>cheaper yet maybe better editor, Filmora</strong>. Click and have a try!</p>

<p>Answer: The Pro Apps Bundle for Education includes full versions of each software similar to the apps or games you normally download or buy through the App Store. As of now, the bundle and its apps have unlimited ownership and access.</p>
<p><strong>Question: Can I update apps in the education bundle?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Yes. Go to Finder &gt; App Store. Type any app in the bundle, for example, Final Cut Pro, in the search bar. In the search results. Locate the app, and if Apple released an update for Final Cut Pro, there would be an ‘Update’ button. Click it, and the app will be updated.</p>
<p><strong>Question: Can I download the pro app bundle on PC?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: Unfortunately, no. Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education is only available for MacBooks, iMacs, Mac Pros, and Mac Minis. Apple has not released or will never make their proprietary software for Windows and other platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Question: Can I buy the bundle with friends because I don’t need all the apps?</strong></p>
<p>Answer: The Pro Apps Bundle for Education is delivered to you in an email as a list of unique redemption codes for each software. One of the major issues associated with purchasing Apple professional software (such as Final Cut Pro or Logic Studio) is that the license isn’t transferable. Your purchase can only be moved from one personal Mac to another—not given away or combined with someone else’s ID. Once you buy it, your Apple ID will forever stay attached to this product, and all its limitations are yours as well.</p>
