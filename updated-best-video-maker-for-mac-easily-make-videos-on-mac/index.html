<h5 id="Ollie-Mattison"><a href="#Ollie-Mattison" class="headerlink" title="Ollie Mattison"></a>Ollie Mattison</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p>
<p>Finding a good video maker for Mac is not always easy – not for lack of options, there are many applications out there, but there are <strong>two main limitations</strong>: money, first and foremost, we all know how expensive video makers – good video makers – can be. The second limitation is complexity: sometimes you end up spending more time reading the help instead of editing, and the application you’ve chosen probably contains the features that you need – except that you have serious problems finding them on the menu.</p>
<p><a href="#part1">1. Wondershare Filmora Video Maker for Mac</a><br><a href="#part2">2. iMovie</a><br><a href="#part3">3. Blender</a></p>
<h2 id="Best-Video-Maker-for-Mac"><a href="#Best-Video-Maker-for-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Maker for Mac"></a>Best Video Maker for Mac</h2><p>Some video makers manage to stay on top by avoiding, or at least limiting these problems, and here are three of those.</p>
<h3 id="1-Vieo-Maker-on-Mac-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Maker-for-Mac"><a href="#1-Vieo-Maker-on-Mac-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Maker-for-Mac" class="headerlink" title="1.Vieo Maker on Mac: Wondershare Filmora Video Maker for Mac"></a>1.Vieo Maker on Mac: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Maker for Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Wondershare Filmora for Mac offers perhaps the best value for money (not to mention that it has a free version as well if you’d like to try it first. It supports pretty much any format you may think of (AVI, MP4, MOV, MPG, MKV, TRP, and so on), and it’s quite easy to use when it comes to the most basic features you’d expect in a video editor, such as cropping, joining, trimming, and rotating, as well as for adding some effects, transitions, and sound effects.</p>
<p>Because of that, Wondershare Filmora may actually be deceptively simple – because it’s capable of much more powerful features, if you take your time to study all its options, such as <strong>picture in picture, green screen</strong>, if you fancy yourself the next Hollywood director, adjustable playback speed, separation of the audio track from the original video file, tilt-shift effects, which can create very interesting results in a video, automatic noise reduction, and image enhancement, to bring back to life the subjects of the video, and automatic scene detection – allowing you to create a new video clip every time a scene changes. And there are a lot more things you can discover for yourself if you spend some time playing around.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora will also allow you to upload your creations directly to <strong>Facebook or YouTube</strong>, or to burn them on DVDs, so you can get straight into the next project without wasting any time.</p>

<h3 id="2-Video-Maker-for-Mac-iMovie"><a href="#2-Video-Maker-for-Mac-iMovie" class="headerlink" title="2. Video Maker for Mac: iMovie"></a>2. Video Maker for Mac: iMovie</h3><p>iMovie is the proprietary software provided by Apple as part of its iLife suit. You may find it already installed on your Mac if you’ve just purchased a new machine. If not, it’s free to use after you purchase iLife.</p>
<p>It’s not the most powerful and complex application out there, as you can imagine for a piece of software that comes pre-installed, but it’s a good first stop for people who are just starting out in this field and need to learn the basics of editing videos on Mac without too many headaches.</p>
<p>It has many easy-to-use effects and lots of build-in animations, music samples, and sounds to get you started on your first project immediately.</p>
<p>Granted, iMovie has sacrificed a lot of features for the simplicity of use – sooner or later you’ll want to move on to something more complex, but, for beginners and for people who just need to add a few editing touches to a project here and there, this is a more than the reasonable solution. Don’t let yourself put off by the fact iMovie has a rather bad reputation online – of course, that very advanced users are disappointed by it, but you can use it for a while and you’ll know when it’s time to move on.</p>
<h3 id="3-Video-Maker-on-Mac-Blender"><a href="#3-Video-Maker-on-Mac-Blender" class="headerlink" title="3. Video Maker on Mac: Blender"></a>3. Video Maker on Mac: Blender</h3><p>When you’ve exhausted the possibilities offered by iMovie and you need more power, Blender will be there, waiting for you.

<p>Like all open source applications, Blender is not the most intuitive at the first glance, but it more than compensates with the impressive range of features that bring it to the same level as a professional application. If you’ve been struggling to get everything just perfect before, now you’ll have everything you need at your fingertips and you only need to unleash your imagination. It’s 3D modeling options have been frequently compared to those that can only be found in applications that cost more than your Mac (maybe even more than your car, come to think of it).</p>
<p>Moreover, the community will always be there for you – if you have any questions or if you get stuck, you only need to post a question online and somebody will be there to help you out – not to mention the very large number of tutorials available online, with more being added almost daily.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure about this, you may want to start by searching online for clips created entirely with Blender. Of course, yours won’t be masterpieces from day one, it will take some time to get used to this application – but you’ll get some idea of how powerful it can be, and the level of mastery that you’ll want to achieve, eventually.</p>

<p>Finding a good video maker for Mac is not always easy – not for lack of options, there are many applications out there, but there are <strong>two main limitations</strong>: money, first and foremost, we all know how expensive video makers – good video makers – can be. The second limitation is complexity: sometimes you end up spending more time reading the help instead of editing, and the application you’ve chosen probably contains the features that you need – except that you have serious problems finding them on the menu.</p>
<p><a href="#part1">1. Wondershare Filmora Video Maker for Mac</a><br><a href="#part2">2. iMovie</a><br><a href="#part3">3. Blender</a></p>

<h3 id="1-Vieo-Maker-on-Mac-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Maker-for-Mac-1"><a href="#1-Vieo-Maker-on-Mac-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Maker-for-Mac-1" class="headerlink" title="1.Vieo Maker on Mac: Wondershare Filmora Video Maker for Mac"></a>1.Vieo Maker on Mac: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Maker for Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Wondershare Filmora for Mac offers perhaps the best value for money (not to mention that it has a free version as well if you’d like to try it first. It supports pretty much any format you may think of (AVI, MP4, MOV, MPG, MKV, TRP, and so on), and it’s quite easy to use when it comes to the most basic features you’d expect in a video editor, such as cropping, joining, trimming, and rotating, as well as for adding some effects, transitions, and sound effects.</p>
<p>Because of that, Wondershare Filmora may actually be deceptively simple – because it’s capable of much more powerful features, if you take your time to study all its options, such as <strong>picture in picture, green screen</strong>, if you fancy yourself the next Hollywood director, adjustable playback speed, separation of the audio track from the original video file, tilt-shift effects, which can create very interesting results in a video, automatic noise reduction, and image enhancement, to bring back to life the subjects of the video, and automatic scene detection – allowing you to create a new video clip every time a scene changes. And there are a lot more things you can discover for yourself if you spend some time playing around.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora will also allow you to upload your creations directly to <strong>Facebook or YouTube</strong>, or to burn them on DVDs, so you can get straight into the next project without wasting any time.</p>

You may find it already installed on your Mac if you’ve just purchased a new machine. If not, it’s free to use after you purchase iLife.</p>
<p>It’s not the most powerful and complex application out there, as you can imagine for a piece of software that comes pre-installed, but it’s a good first stop for people who are just starting out in this field and need to learn the basics of editing videos on Mac without too many headaches.</p>
<p>It has many easy-to-use effects and lots of build-in animations, music samples, and sounds to get you started on your first project immediately.</p>
<p>Granted, iMovie has sacrificed a lot of features for the simplicity of use – sooner or later you’ll want to move on to something more complex, but, for beginners and for people who just need to add a few editing touches to a project here and there, this is a more than the reasonable solution. Don’t let yourself put off by the fact iMovie has a rather bad reputation online – of course, that very advanced users are disappointed by it, but you can use it for a while and you’ll know when it’s time to move on.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-2D-Animation"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-2D-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Make 2D Animation"></a>Part 3: How to Make 2D Animation</h2><p> <strong>Step 1  Put forward an idea</strong></p>
<p>A story ides is priceless. It is always important to build an essential story frame. Sometimes it is in a blink to have come up with an idea.</p>
<p>It will help if you <strong>decide the gist</strong> of your 2D animation because the whole process of making animation is evolving. You may need to add or cut some scenes, but the overall concept and story ideas are always the same.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-best-2d-animation-software-in-2022-01.gif"
                      alt="Put forward an idea"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 2  Make a storyboard</strong></p>
<p>After all the ideas are fixed, you need to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.bloopanimation.com/how-to-storyboard/" >make a storyboard for animation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You don’t need to produce every scene, but it is suggested to make a storyboard in some crucial scenes. Storyboarding is probably the best way to show 2D animation to other people and get feedback.</p>
<p>Thus, it is a step that you should not neglect during the preliminary.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-best-2d-animation-software-in-2022-02.gif"
                      alt="make storyboard"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 3  Produce materials</strong></p>
<p>At this stage, you need to prepare all the 2D animation materials, including characters, background, and props. One thing you need to know is all the preparations in steps 2 and 3 should be ready before proceeding to step 3.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-best-2d-animation-software-in-2022-03.gif"
                      alt="Produce materials"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 4  Animation</strong></p>
<p>After all, materials are ready, and you need to make animation alive. In this step, you need to make sure all the movements are natural. Stiff moves are not liked by the audience, so you need to think about how to design gestures, movements, and facial expressions.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animation"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 5  Animation editing</strong></p>
<p>In this step, the software is the key to relive the 2D animation. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Background audio is essential <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and needs to be added to the video. Color correction and grading are also necessary. Besides, scene transition, voiceover, and even text credit need to be added.</p>
<p>Above are the five 2D animation steps. If you think there are extra steps, you are free to add them according to your needs.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-2D-Animation-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-2D-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Make 2D Animation"></a>Part 3: How to Make 2D Animation</h2><p> <strong>Step 1  Put forward an idea</strong></p>
<p>A story ides is priceless. It is always important to build an essential story frame. Sometimes it is in a blink to have come up with an idea.</p>
<p>It will help if you <strong>decide the gist</strong> of your 2D animation because the whole process of making animation is evolving. You may need to add or cut some scenes, but the overall concept and story ideas are always the same.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-best-2d-animation-software-in-2022-01.gif"
                      alt="Put forward an idea"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 2  Make a storyboard</strong></p>
<p>After all the ideas are fixed, you need to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.bloopanimation.com/how-to-storyboard/" >make a storyboard for animation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You don’t need to produce every scene, but it is suggested to make a storyboard in some crucial scenes. Storyboarding is probably the best way to show 2D animation to other people and get feedback.</p>
<p>Thus, it is a step that you should not neglect during the preliminary.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-best-2d-animation-software-in-2022-02.gif"
                      alt="make storyboard"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 3  Produce materials</strong></p>
<p>At this stage, you need to prepare all the 2D animation materials, including characters, background, and props. One thing you need to know is all the preparations in steps 2 and 3 should be ready before proceeding to step 3.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Produce materials"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 4  Animation</strong></p>
<p>After all, materials are ready, and you need to make animation alive. In this step, you need to make sure all the movements are natural. Stiff moves are not liked by the audience, so you need to think about how to design gestures, movements, and facial expressions.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animation"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 5  Animation editing</strong></p>
<p>In this step, the software is the key to relive the 2D animation. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Background audio is essential <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and needs to be added to the video. Color correction and grading are also necessary. Besides, scene transition, voiceover, and even text credit need to be added.</p>
<p>Above are the five 2D animation steps. If you think there are extra steps, you are free to add them according to your needs.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-2D-Animation-2"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-2D-Animation-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Make 2D Animation"></a>Part 3: How to Make 2D Animation</h2><p> <strong>Step 1  Put forward an idea</strong></p>
<p>A story ides is priceless. It is always important to build an essential story frame. Sometimes it is in a blink to have come up with an idea.</p>
<p>It will help if you <strong>decide the gist</strong> of your 2D animation because the whole process of making animation is evolving. You may need to add or cut some scenes, but the overall concept and story ideas are always the same.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-best-2d-animation-software-in-2022-01.gif"
                      alt="Put forward an idea"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 2  Make a storyboard</strong></p>
<p>After all the ideas are fixed, you need to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.bloopanimation.com/how-to-storyboard/" >make a storyboard for animation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You don’t need to produce every scene, but it is suggested to make a storyboard in some crucial scenes. Storyboarding is probably the best way to show 2D animation to other people and get feedback.</p>
<p>Thus, it is a step that you should not neglect during the preliminary.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-best-2d-animation-software-in-2022-02.gif"
                      alt="make storyboard"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 3  Produce materials</strong></p>
<p>At this stage, you need to prepare all the 2D animation materials, including characters, background, and props. One thing you need to know is all the preparations in steps 2 and 3 should be ready before proceeding to step 3.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-best-2d-animation-software-in-2022-03.gif"
                      alt="Produce materials"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 4  Animation</strong></p>
<p>After all, materials are ready, and you need to make animation alive. In this step, you need to make sure all the movements are natural. Stiff moves are not liked by the audience, so you need to think about how to design gestures, movements, and facial expressions.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-best-2d-animation-software-in-2022-04.gif"
                      alt="Animation"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 5  Animation editing</strong></p>
<p>In this step, the software is the key to relive the 2D animation. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Background audio is essential <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and needs to be added to the video. Color correction and grading are also necessary. Besides, scene transition, voiceover, and even text credit need to be added.</p>
<p>Above are the five 2D animation steps. If you think there are extra steps, you are free to add them according to your needs.</p>
<h2 id="Bonus-tip-Create-an-Animation-Video-with-Anireel-2"><a href="#Bonus-tip-Create-an-Animation-Video-with-Anireel-2" class="headerlink" title="Bonus tip: Create an Animation Video with Anireel"></a>Bonus tip: Create an Animation Video with Anireel</h2><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/anireel/download/"><strong>Anireel</strong></a> provides a faster and smoother animated video creation experience with customizable elements to bring anyone’s imagination to life.

<p>A story ides is priceless. It is always important to build an essential story frame. Sometimes it is in a blink to have come up with an idea.</p>
<p>It will help if you <strong>decide the gist</strong> of your 2D animation because the whole process of making animation is evolving. You may need to add or cut some scenes, but the overall concept and story ideas are always the same.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-best-2d-animation-software-in-2022-01.gif"
                      alt="Put forward an idea"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 2  Make a storyboard</strong></p>
<p>After all the ideas are fixed, you need to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.bloopanimation.com/how-to-storyboard/" >make a storyboard for animation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You don’t need to produce every scene, but it is suggested to make a storyboard in some crucial scenes. Storyboarding is probably the best way to show 2D animation to other people and get feedback.</p>
<p>Thus, it is a step that you should not neglect during the preliminary.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-best-2d-animation-software-in-2022-02.gif"
                      alt="make storyboard"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 3  Produce materials</strong></p>
<p>At this stage, you need to prepare all the 2D animation materials, including characters, background, and props. One thing you need to know is all the preparations in steps 2 and 3 should be ready before proceeding to step 3.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Produce materials"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 4  Animation</strong></p>
<p>After all, materials are ready, and you need to make animation alive. In this step, you need to make sure all the movements are natural. Stiff moves are not liked by the audience, so you need to think about how to design gestures, movements, and facial expressions.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animation"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 5  Animation editing</strong></p>
<p>In this step, the software is the key to relive the 2D animation. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Background audio is essential <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and needs to be added to the video. Color correction and grading are also necessary. Besides, scene transition, voiceover, and even text credit need to be added.</p>
<p>Above are the five 2D animation steps. If you think there are extra steps, you are free to add them according to your needs.</p>

You don’t need professional camera equipment if you want to create time-lapse videos you can share on your social media accounts because there are plenty of apps that let you create these types of videos directly from your Smartphones. So, in this article, we are going to introduce you to some of the best time-lapse apps for iPhone and Android devices in 2020.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Time-Lapse-Apps-for-Android-and-iPhone-Devices-in-2021"><a href="#Best-Time-Lapse-Apps-for-Android-and-iPhone-Devices-in-2021" class="headerlink" title="Best Time-Lapse Apps for Android and iPhone Devices in 2021"></a>Best Time-Lapse Apps for Android and iPhone Devices in 2021</h2><p>The quality of your time-lapse video doesn’t depend only on the number of tools an app offers, which is why you must do everything in your power to record the footage that doesn’t contain camera shakes or any other common mistakes. With that being said, let’s take a look at the five best time-lapse apps you can find on GooglePlay or on the AppStore.</p>
<h4 id="1-Microsoft-Hyperlapse-Mobile"><a href="#1-Microsoft-Hyperlapse-Mobile" class="headerlink" title="1.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Android 4.4 or later</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.2</p>
<p>This Android-based application makes the creation of time-lapse videos look easy. You just have to select the speed at which you want to record a video, choose between 720p and 1080p resolutions and hit the record button. The app lets you increase the video’s speed up to 32 times, enabling you to create seamless time-lapses, although the video stabilization feature is only available if you’re recording a video at a normal speed. That is why you must ensure that your phone is perfectly stable while the recording is in progress if you want to create a smooth time-lapse. Microsoft Hyperlapse Mobile lets you share your creations on Instagram, Facebook, and other popular social media networks or save the time-lapse you’ve created to your phone’s SD card.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS 9.0 or later</p>

Besides creating slow motion and time-lapse videos, you can also use this app to enhance the colors in the footage you’re editing, crop or trim video clips and add customized text overlays to the videos. The app also features a wide spectrum of filters and allows you to add sound effects or music to the video you’re working on. Keep in mind that you have to make an in-app purchase if you want to remove the watermark from your videos or if you want to export your time-lapse and slow-motion videos in Full HD resolution.</p>

<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.1 on AppStore, 4.3 on Google Play</p>

The time-lapse videos you create with this iOS-based app can be easily saved to your phone’s camera roll or shared to Instagram in only a few taps. The only downside is that Hyperlapse for Instagram doesn’t offer any video editing tools.</p>
<h4 id="5-Framelapse"><a href="#5-Framelapse" class="headerlink" title="5. Framelapse"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Nishant.Singh.DroidTimelapse&hl=en" >Framelapse <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>

Twitter also recommends that if your video is in the portrait or landscape mode then it must be in the aspect ratio of 16:9 and if you are creating the videos in square mode then it should be in 1:1 aspect ratio. By using these video aspect ratios you can boost the experience while watching the videos.</p>
