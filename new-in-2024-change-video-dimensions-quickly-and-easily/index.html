<p>As its name suggests, this app allows you to create both photo and video collages. You can either use the existing material from your camera roll or use the Video Collage and Photo Grid app to capture new footage. You can choose from 64 fully customizable layouts and pick the texture or the color of the frames of each video or photo you include in the collage. The app also lets you adjust the sizes of the still and moving images you’re combining and it also offers the possibility to crop photos you’d like to use in your collages. The sound volume can be easily adjusted, but you must make an in-app purchase in order to unlock the background music feature.</p>

<p>This versatile app can be used for much more than just creating video collages, as it offers the option to capture videos in Full HD and 4K resolutions, although the 4K option is only available on iPhone Xs and iPad Pro. Moreover, you can combine several video collages into a single video and apply a variety of transitions to ensure the smooth flow of the output video. Adding text layers, recording voiceovers or creating soundtracks for your video collages are just a few options you’ll have at your disposal if you install the PicPlayPost movie video editor on your iOS-based device. In case you’re planning on using this app on a daily basis, you should consider purchasing the Everything Pack that costs just $24.99.</p>

<p>The fact that PicStich offers more than 300 different layouts speaks volumes about its capabilities. However, the majority of the app’s features are designed to help you create photo collages. You can still add a song you like to a video collage to make it more entertaining to watch, but unfortunately, PicStich doesn’t let you apply transitions or adjust playback speeds of the videos you include in a video collage. Purchasing Frames and Borders packs will extend the scope of your options and enable you to increase the quality of the video collages you’re making. The app’s file-sharing capabilities are impressive since you can export your projects directly to Instagram or Dropbox and you can also share all of your creations to Facebook, Twitter, and other popular social networks.</p>

The free version of VidStich is going to watermark all your creations and it won’t allow you to add music to your collages, which is why purchasing the Pro pack and additional frames and borders will help you produce visual content that is going to impress your followers on social media.</p>

<p>MP4 is a very common media format that can keep the high image and sound quality. Many downloaded movies, streaming music videos, or recorded video clips are with .MP4 file extension. Confused about different kinds of formats? Check out <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY1IQUuQBME" >this video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>to learn what video format is and the differences between video formats.</p>
<p>If you have many such files, chances are that you need to edit MP4 videos.</p>
<p>Although various MP4 editors are available on the market, they are a little space-consuming in order to ensure good performance. Here I’d like to share a powerful and efficient MP4 editor that designed for beginners and hobbyists.</p>
<p>It’s Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor). With it, you’re able to trim, rotate, crop, merge MP4 files, as well as personalize your MP4 videos with rich text, filter and transitions. Moreover, after you finish MP4 video editing, you can directly share your creation on YouTube, Facebook, or save to any format you want.</p>

<p>MP4 is a very common media format that can keep the high image and sound quality. Many downloaded movies, streaming music videos, or recorded video clips are with .MP4 file extension. Confused about different kinds of formats? Check out <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY1IQUuQBME" >this video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>to learn what video format is and the differences between video formats.</p>
<p>If you have many such files, chances are that you need to edit MP4 videos.</p>
<p>Although various MP4 editors are available on the market, they are a little space-consuming in order to ensure good performance. Here I’d like to share a powerful and efficient MP4 editor that designed for beginners and hobbyists.</p>
<p>It’s Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor). With it, you’re able to trim, rotate, crop, merge MP4 files, as well as personalize your MP4 videos with rich text, filter and transitions. Moreover, after you finish MP4 video editing, you can directly share your creation on YouTube, Facebook, or save to any format you want.</p>

Cut MP4 Video</h4><p>To cut your MP4 video into certain parts, drag and drop the video on the Timeline and highlight it. Then place the red Time Indicator to where you want to cut the video, and click the Scissor button above the timeline.</p>
<p>After that, move the red marker to the end of the scene, and repeat this again to cut the video into several fragments. If you want to cut off the unwanted parts, right click the video and choose “Delete”.</p>

Join MP4 Video</h4><p>To join several MP4 video files into one, you just need to place all the video files on the timeline, adjust the order and hit “Create” to export it.</p>
<p>If you want to make the joined videos look like a really intact movie, just add transitions between clips for smooth change from one to next. To do this, click “Transition” tab on the main screen. Then drag the effect you like to the timeline to apply.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to choose the transition one by one, let the software choose the transition randomly by right clicking and selecting “Random to All” option.</p>

<p>Want to change the original audio track of your MP4 video?</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>Just highlight your MP4 video, right click and choose “Audio Detach”. The audio file of your video will immediately be separated and appear on the music timeline. Since it is separated from the video, you can easily delete the audio track or replace it with your own music.</p>
