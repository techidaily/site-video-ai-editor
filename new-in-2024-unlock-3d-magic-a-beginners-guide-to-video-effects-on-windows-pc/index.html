<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>You can follow the step-by-step instructions that are given below to learn how to add 3D effects to a video with Wondershare Filmora:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import Source Video and Add It to the Timeline</strong></p>
<p>After installing Wondershare Filmora on Windows 10 or Windows 11, launch the program, click anywhere inside the Media box present at the upper-left section of the interface, and locate and import the source video to the program. Next, hover the mouse over the thumbnail of the video, click the <strong>+</strong> icon from the bottom-right corner.</p>
<p>When the confirmation box appears, either click <strong>Match to Media</strong> or <strong>Keep Project Settings</strong> to adjust the project settings according to the media clip or modify the media clip according to the project preferences while adding the footage to the Timeline respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add 3D Titles and Transitions</strong></p>
<p>Click <strong>Titles</strong> from the toolbox at the top, type <strong>3D Titles</strong> in the <strong>Search titles</strong> field present at the upper section of the upper-left box, and click <strong>3D titles</strong> from the suggestions list.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-3d-title-effects-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="find 3d title effects filmora"
                ></p>
<p>From all the available 3D title presets that appear next, drag the one you like to the Timeline, and place it above the video track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-title-effects-to-video-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="add 3d title effects to video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>After this, double-click the placeholder text in the <strong>Preview</strong> window, and replace it with your caption. You can customize the font, color, and alignment of the text from the options that appear on left. Click <strong>OK</strong> from the lower-left area of the left pane to exit the editing mode. Repeat the process for all the texts that the preset has. Optionally, drag the sides of the 3D title in the Timeline to specify its duration of visibility on the screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-3d-title-effects-in-video-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="edit 3d title effects in video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>To add the transitions, click <strong>Media</strong> from the toolbox at the top, click <strong>Import Media</strong> from the <strong>Media</strong> box, and repeat the process explained earlier to add a new video clip to the Timeline. Make sure that both the clips are on the same track, and are placed next to each other. Now, go to <strong>Transitions</strong> from the toolbox, and drag and place your preferred transition effect between the two media clips in the Timeline. Optionally you can drag the sides of the transition inwards or outwards to increase or decrease the speed of the effect respectively.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-transition-effects-to-video-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="add 3d transition effects to video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>After this, move the <strong>Playhead</strong> (<strong>Skimmer</strong>) to the beginning of the Timeline, and press the <strong>Spacebar</strong> on your keyboard to preview the video.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is a good practice to preview your video several times during the entire editing process. This will help you identify the error sooner, and you will be able to address the issue with fewer hassles.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Elements and Effects</strong></p>
<p>Go to <strong>Elements</strong> from the toolbox, drag your preferred element from the upper-left box to the Timeline, and place it on a new track. You can drag the sides of the element in the Timeline to increase or decrease its visibility during video playback.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-elements-to-video-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="add 3d elements to video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>To add effects, go to <strong>Effects</strong> from the toolbox, drag your preferred effect from the upper-left box, and place it on a new layer in the Timeline. As it is with other entities, you can drag the sides of the effect to increase or decrease the duration of its impact on the video. Next, double-click the <strong>Effects</strong> layer in the Timeline, and use the available options in the box to make further adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The options that you get by double-clicking the effect in the Timeline may vary according to the adjustments it allows you to make.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-effects-to-video-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="add 3d effects to video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Once this is done, preview the video, click <strong>Export</strong> from the top-center, and use the tabs and options on the <strong>Export</strong> box to export the modified video in your preferred format.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>If you are new to the VFX and video editing industry, trying hands with the Photos app would give you a fair idea about how things work. Once you are well-versed or if you are already a post-production professional, you can and you must go for a dedicated program like Wondershare Filmora that not only has an intuitive interface, it is also equipped with a plethora of presets to add 3D titles, elements, transitions, and effects to the videos without much hassle.</p>

<p>You can follow the step-by-step instructions that are given below to learn how to add 3D effects to a video with Wondershare Filmora:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import Source Video and Add It to the Timeline</strong></p>
<p>After installing Wondershare Filmora on Windows 10 or Windows 11, launch the program, click anywhere inside the Media box present at the upper-left section of the interface, and locate and import the source video to the program. Next, hover the mouse over the thumbnail of the video, click the <strong>+</strong> icon from the bottom-right corner.</p>
<p>When the confirmation box appears, either click <strong>Match to Media</strong> or <strong>Keep Project Settings</strong> to adjust the project settings according to the media clip or modify the media clip according to the project preferences while adding the footage to the Timeline respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add 3D Titles and Transitions</strong></p>
<p>Click <strong>Titles</strong> from the toolbox at the top, type <strong>3D Titles</strong> in the <strong>Search titles</strong> field present at the upper section of the upper-left box, and click <strong>3D titles</strong> from the suggestions list.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="find 3d title effects filmora"
                ></p>
<p>From all the available 3D title presets that appear next, drag the one you like to the Timeline, and place it above the video track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add 3d title effects to video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>After this, double-click the placeholder text in the <strong>Preview</strong> window, and replace it with your caption. You can customize the font, color, and alignment of the text from the options that appear on left. Click <strong>OK</strong> from the lower-left area of the left pane to exit the editing mode. Repeat the process for all the texts that the preset has. Optionally, drag the sides of the 3D title in the Timeline to specify its duration of visibility on the screen.</p>

                ></p>
<p>To add the transitions, click <strong>Media</strong> from the toolbox at the top, click <strong>Import Media</strong> from the <strong>Media</strong> box, and repeat the process explained earlier to add a new video clip to the Timeline. Make sure that both the clips are on the same track, and are placed next to each other. Now, go to <strong>Transitions</strong> from the toolbox, and drag and place your preferred transition effect between the two media clips in the Timeline. Optionally you can drag the sides of the transition inwards or outwards to increase or decrease the speed of the effect respectively.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>After this, move the <strong>Playhead</strong> (<strong>Skimmer</strong>) to the beginning of the Timeline, and press the <strong>Spacebar</strong> on your keyboard to preview the video.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is a good practice to preview your video several times during the entire editing process. This will help you identify the error sooner, and you will be able to address the issue with fewer hassles.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Elements and Effects</strong></p>
<p>Go to <strong>Elements</strong> from the toolbox, drag your preferred element from the upper-left box to the Timeline, and place it on a new track. You can drag the sides of the element in the Timeline to increase or decrease its visibility during video playback.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="add 3d elements to video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>To add effects, go to <strong>Effects</strong> from the toolbox, drag your preferred effect from the upper-left box, and place it on a new layer in the Timeline. As it is with other entities, you can drag the sides of the effect to increase or decrease the duration of its impact on the video. Next, double-click the <strong>Effects</strong> layer in the Timeline, and use the available options in the box to make further adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The options that you get by double-clicking the effect in the Timeline may vary according to the adjustments it allows you to make.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add 3d effects to video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Once this is done, preview the video, click <strong>Export</strong> from the top-center, and use the tabs and options on the <strong>Export</strong> box to export the modified video in your preferred format.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>If you are new to the VFX and video editing industry, trying hands with the Photos app would give you a fair idea about how things work. Once you are well-versed or if you are already a post-production professional, you can and you must go for a dedicated program like Wondershare Filmora that not only has an intuitive interface, it is also equipped with a plethora of presets to add 3D titles, elements, transitions, and effects to the videos without much hassle.</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>You can follow the step-by-step instructions that are given below to learn how to add 3D effects to a video with Wondershare Filmora:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import Source Video and Add It to the Timeline</strong></p>
<p>After installing Wondershare Filmora on Windows 10 or Windows 11, launch the program, click anywhere inside the Media box present at the upper-left section of the interface, and locate and import the source video to the program. Next, hover the mouse over the thumbnail of the video, click the <strong>+</strong> icon from the bottom-right corner.</p>
<p>When the confirmation box appears, either click <strong>Match to Media</strong> or <strong>Keep Project Settings</strong> to adjust the project settings according to the media clip or modify the media clip according to the project preferences while adding the footage to the Timeline respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add 3D Titles and Transitions</strong></p>
<p>Click <strong>Titles</strong> from the toolbox at the top, type <strong>3D Titles</strong> in the <strong>Search titles</strong> field present at the upper section of the upper-left box, and click <strong>3D titles</strong> from the suggestions list.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-3d-title-effects-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="find 3d title effects filmora"
                ></p>
<p>From all the available 3D title presets that appear next, drag the one you like to the Timeline, and place it above the video track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-title-effects-to-video-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="add 3d title effects to video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>After this, double-click the placeholder text in the <strong>Preview</strong> window, and replace it with your caption. You can customize the font, color, and alignment of the text from the options that appear on left. Click <strong>OK</strong> from the lower-left area of the left pane to exit the editing mode. Repeat the process for all the texts that the preset has. Optionally, drag the sides of the 3D title in the Timeline to specify its duration of visibility on the screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-3d-title-effects-in-video-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="edit 3d title effects in video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>To add the transitions, click <strong>Media</strong> from the toolbox at the top, click <strong>Import Media</strong> from the <strong>Media</strong> box, and repeat the process explained earlier to add a new video clip to the Timeline. Make sure that both the clips are on the same track, and are placed next to each other. Now, go to <strong>Transitions</strong> from the toolbox, and drag and place your preferred transition effect between the two media clips in the Timeline. Optionally you can drag the sides of the transition inwards or outwards to increase or decrease the speed of the effect respectively.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add 3d transition effects to video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>After this, move the <strong>Playhead</strong> (<strong>Skimmer</strong>) to the beginning of the Timeline, and press the <strong>Spacebar</strong> on your keyboard to preview the video.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is a good practice to preview your video several times during the entire editing process. This will help you identify the error sooner, and you will be able to address the issue with fewer hassles.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Elements and Effects</strong></p>
<p>Go to <strong>Elements</strong> from the toolbox, drag your preferred element from the upper-left box to the Timeline, and place it on a new track. You can drag the sides of the element in the Timeline to increase or decrease its visibility during video playback.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-elements-to-video-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="add 3d elements to video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>To add effects, go to <strong>Effects</strong> from the toolbox, drag your preferred effect from the upper-left box, and place it on a new layer in the Timeline. As it is with other entities, you can drag the sides of the effect to increase or decrease the duration of its impact on the video. Next, double-click the <strong>Effects</strong> layer in the Timeline, and use the available options in the box to make further adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The options that you get by double-clicking the effect in the Timeline may vary according to the adjustments it allows you to make.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-effects-to-video-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="add 3d effects to video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Once this is done, preview the video, click <strong>Export</strong> from the top-center, and use the tabs and options on the <strong>Export</strong> box to export the modified video in your preferred format.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>If you are new to the VFX and video editing industry, trying hands with the Photos app would give you a fair idea about how things work. Once you are well-versed or if you are already a post-production professional, you can and you must go for a dedicated program like Wondershare Filmora that not only has an intuitive interface, it is also equipped with a plethora of presets to add 3D titles, elements, transitions, and effects to the videos without much hassle.</p>
