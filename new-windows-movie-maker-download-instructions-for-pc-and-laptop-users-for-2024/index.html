<p>The following steps explain how to create a split screen video with Kapwing:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add Clips to Preset</strong></p>
<p>Go to the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.kapwing.com/collage" >https://www.kapwing.com/collage <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> link, click to select your preferred split screen preset, click <strong>REPLACE</strong> on one of the segments of the split screen on the next page, and select and upload the first video. Next, click <strong>REPLACE</strong> on the other segment(s), and select and upload the other videos as well.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Reposition and Publish</strong></p>
<p>Click and drag each of the added clips to reposition them on the screen, use the other tools to crop and adjust the videos as needed, and click <strong>Publish</strong> from the top-right corner. <strong>Note:</strong> Optionally you can click <strong>Timeline</strong> from the top of the preview window, adjust the timings and other settings as needed on the next page, and click <strong>Done</strong>. After this, you can go ahead and hit <strong>Publish</strong> to create the split screen effect out of the uploaded videos.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Free to use</li>
<li>Allows as many as 4 videos to create split screen effect</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h3 id="2-WeVideo-3"><a href="#2-WeVideo-3" class="headerlink" title="2. WeVideo"></a>2. WeVideo</h3><p>Yet another <strong>split screen video maker online free</strong> solution, WeVideo offers almost desktop program-like experience while creating split screen effects. Even though all the subscription plans that the vendor offers are chargeable, the <strong>Education</strong> plan can be tried for 30 days for free, post which the teachers are required to pay to continue using the web tool.</p>
<p>The following steps explain how to get split screen effect with WeVideo:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import Videos</strong></p>
<p>Visit <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.wevideo.com/" >https://www.wevideo.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and on the main window, click <strong>Video</strong> from under the <strong>Create a new</strong> section at the top, select a layout on the <strong>Let’s get started</strong> box, and click <strong>START EDITING</strong> from the bottom right corner. Next, click <strong>ADD</strong> in the <strong>My media</strong> window in the upper-left section, click <strong>BROWSE TO SELECT</strong> on the <strong>Import media</strong> box, and add the videos you want to use in the split screen effect.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add Clips to Timeline</strong></p>
<p>As explained earlier, drag the videos from the <strong>My media</strong> pane and drop them in the Timeline. Make sure to place every video in its separate layer, and that all the layers are on top of each other.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Create Split Screen Effect</strong></p>
<p>Select any clip in the Timeline, and click the <strong>Open clip editor</strong> icon from the upper-left area of the track. On the next page, use the <strong>Scale</strong> slider to reduce the size of the selected clip, and from the preview window in the right, drag to reposition the video to your preferred location on the screen. Click <strong>SAVE CHANGES</strong> from the bottom of the left pane to confirm the settings. Repeat the process for the second clip in the Timeline to resize and reposition it on the screen. Click <strong>FINISH</strong> from the upper-right corner, on the next box, enter a name for the video in the available field, click <strong>SET</strong>, choose your preferred settings on the next page, and click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the bottom-right corner to produce the split screen video.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Free to use</li>
<li>Allows multiple videos to be used for split screen</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Paid subscription is needed to remove watermark from the outputs</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="FAQs-About-Split-Screen-Video-Editors-3"><a href="#FAQs-About-Split-Screen-Video-Editors-3" class="headerlink" title="FAQs About Split Screen Video Editors"></a>FAQs About Split Screen Video Editors</h3><h4 id="Why-you-should-use-split-screen-effect-in-video-3"><a href="#Why-you-should-use-split-screen-effect-in-video-3" class="headerlink" title="Why you should use split screen effect in video?"></a>Why you should use split screen effect in video?</h4><p>There are a couple of reasons you may want to use split screen effect in your video. Some of the most common uses include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Showing multiple actions by the same or different characters at the same time, without changing the screen</li>
<li>Comparing multiple objects or picture quality. This can be done only when the entities in question are placed side-by-side</li>
<li>Making your video look more professional</li>
<li>Showing different effects on the same screen</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Can-I-create-a-split-screen-video-with-Windows-Movie-Maker-or-Windows-10-Photos-app-3"><a href="#Can-I-create-a-split-screen-video-with-Windows-Movie-Maker-or-Windows-10-Photos-app-3" class="headerlink" title="Can I create a split screen video with Windows Movie Maker or Windows 10 Photos app?"></a>Can I create a split screen video with Windows Movie Maker or Windows 10 Photos app?</h4><p>No, you cannot. Although these tools enable you to resize the videos, since they don’t allow multi-tracked Timelines, no video clips can be placed one above the other which is an essential part for any <strong>split screen video maker</strong> to create the effect. However, as discussed above, there are several post-production tools, offline and online, that allow you to make split screen videos easily and without any cost.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Split screen video editor</strong></a> tools are both paid and free. Regardless of the program you use to create the effect, the output files always look more professional and informative. Furthermore, things become way simpler if the <strong>split screen video maker</strong> has simple UI, is less resource intensive, and is easy to use as it is the case with Wondershare Filmora.</p>
