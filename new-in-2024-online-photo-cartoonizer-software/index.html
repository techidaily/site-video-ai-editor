<p>Cartooning a photo is a simple and yet effective way of enhancing a picture and making it more visually appealing. Besides adding an artistic touch to portraits you take, cartooning a photo can also be a great way to have fun with your friends because the results of picture cartooning can be as entertaining as visually striking.</p>
<p>Besides portraiture, this visual effect can be applied to virtually any other genre of photography, although the contents of the shoot usually determine how well the effect is going to work. What’s more, you don’t need a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >professional video editing software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to cartoon a photo, since there are so many websites that let you apply this effect to your photos for free.</p>
<p>That’s why we selected some of the best websites for converting a photo into a cartoon.</p>

<h3 id="Part-1-Best-Free-Online-Cartoon-Photo-Editors"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Free-Online-Cartoon-Photo-Editors" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Best Free Online Cartoon Photo Editors"></a>Part 1: Best Free Online Cartoon Photo Editors</h3><p>You don’t have to purchase an expensive photo editing software if you want to cartoon your photos because there are so many different online photo editing platforms that allow you to apply this effect to your photos for free. Let’s take a closer look at what they have to offer.</p>
<h4 id="2-BeFunky"><a href="#2-BeFunky" class="headerlink" title="2. BeFunky"></a>2. BeFunky</h4><p>Befunky is one of the best photo editors you can find online, which is why it is hardly surprising that it offers cartoonization effects. In fact, you can choose from <strong>five different cartoonization effects</strong> that are all equally impressive.</p>
<p>All of the cartoon effects Befunky has to offer are located in the Artsy menu, and you just have to click on Cartoonizer DLX, Cross Hatch DLX, Pop Art DLX, or Graphic Novel DLX effects in order to apply them to your photo. Furthermore, you can use the Erase mode if you don’t want to catoonize the entire photo or head over to the Adjust menu to specify the amount of the effect you’ll apply and increase or decrease the photo’s sharpness.</p>
<p>Go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.befunky.com/features/photo-to-cartoon/" >https://www.befunky.com/features/photo-to-cartoon/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and you can then turn your photos to cartoon easily in BeFunky.</p>
<h4 id="3-Lunapic"><a href="#3-Lunapic" class="headerlink" title="3. Lunapic"></a>3. Lunapic</h4><p>This is yet another online photo editing platform that gives you access to a broad range of photo editing options for free. Even though a bit outdated, the Lunapic’s interface resembles Photoshop’s interface, so you won’t need much time to get used to it if you ever used Adobe’s iconic photo editing software.</p>
<p>Once you’ve uploaded a photo, you just have to go to the Effects menu and select the Cartoon option. Lunapic will then automatically apply the effect to the photo you uploaded and you just need to preview the image before you save it. The only downside is that you can’t adjust the effect’s settings in case you don’t like the results.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>It is pretty convenient to reduce the playback speed in VLC media player regardless of the platform or device you are using. While the processes of getting the job might be different, the principle behind it remains the same. When on Windows, the playback speed can be decreased to 0.02x and can be increased to more than 100x. This facility is not available on Mac, iOS, or Android platforms. Also, if you want, you can set the default playback speed for the videos so that every time a clip is played, the pace remains what you specified as default.</p>

You can follow the instructions that are given below to learn how to play a video in slow motion in VLC on a Windows PC:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Start Video Playback</strong></p>
<p>Launch VLC on your Windows computer (a Windows 11 PC is used here for illustrations), click <strong>Media</strong> from the menu bar at the top, click <strong>Open File</strong> from the menu, and locate and open a video that you want to watch in slow motion. If VLC is your default media player, simply double-clicking the clip automatically opens the file in the app.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="open file to play slow motion on vlc"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Reduce the Playback Speed (In Decrements of 0.10x)</strong></p>
<p>Once the playback begins, press the <strong>Spacebar</strong> on the keyboard to pause the video. Next, go to the <strong>Playback</strong> menu from the top, go to <strong>Speed</strong>, and click <strong>Slower (fine)</strong> once. This will reduce the speed to 0.90x. Clicking <strong>Slower (fine)</strong> again will further slow down the video to 0.80x speed. You can repeat this process until you reduce the speed to your desired level. Press <strong>Spacebar</strong> again to resume the playback in slow motion.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The lowest speed that you can go to using this process is 0.03x.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Reduce the Playback Speed (In Decrements in Percentage)</strong></p>
<p>Pause the playback and go to <strong>Playback</strong> &gt; <strong>Speed</strong> as explained in the previous step. From the list that comes up, click <strong>Slower</strong> (the last option). This will reduce the speed to 0.67x. Click <strong>Slower</strong> again and the speed will further go down to 0.50x. You can repeat this process until you reach your desired playback speed. Press <strong>Spacebar</strong> to resume the playback in slow motion. With this method, you can reduce the speed to as low as 0.02x.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can click <strong>Normal</strong> from the <strong>Speed</strong> submenu to play the video at normal speed.</p>

                      alt="play video slow motion on vlc slower"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Using the Shortcut Keys (Optional)</strong></p>
<p>You can press the left square bracket ‘<strong>[</strong>‘ on your keyboard to reduce the speed in decrements of 0.10x. To get back to the normal speed, press the equals to ‘<strong>=</strong>’ key. Likewise, pressing the right square bracket ‘<strong>]</strong>’ increases the speed by 0.10x.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> As it is with the <strong>Slower (fine)</strong> and <strong>Slower</strong> options, you can use <strong>Faster (fine)</strong> to add 0.10x increments to the speed, and <strong>Faster</strong> to increase percentage-wise. Also, if <strong>Faster (fine)</strong> is clicked repeatedly or its shortcut key is used multiple times, the speed can be increased up to 31.25x. On the other hand, by using the <strong>Faster</strong> option repeatedly, the speed can be increased to more than 100x.</p>

<p>Locate and right-click the video that you want to play in slow motion, go to <strong>Open With</strong> from the context menu, and click <strong>VLC</strong> from the submenu. Once the clip opens, click the <strong>Pause</strong> button from the bottom as explained in the previous section.</p>

<p>Launch VLC on your Windows computer (a Windows 11 PC is used here for illustrations), click <strong>Media</strong> from the menu bar at the top, click <strong>Open File</strong> from the menu, and locate and open a video that you want to watch in slow motion. If VLC is your default media player, simply double-clicking the clip automatically opens the file in the app.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Reduce the Playback Speed (In Decrements of 0.10x)</strong></p>
<p>Once the playback begins, press the <strong>Spacebar</strong> on the keyboard to pause the video. Next, go to the <strong>Playback</strong> menu from the top, go to <strong>Speed</strong>, and click <strong>Slower (fine)</strong> once. This will reduce the speed to 0.90x. Clicking <strong>Slower (fine)</strong> again will further slow down the video to 0.80x speed. You can repeat this process until you reduce the speed to your desired level. Press <strong>Spacebar</strong> again to resume the playback in slow motion.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The lowest speed that you can go to using this process is 0.03x.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Reduce the Playback Speed (In Decrements in Percentage)</strong></p>
<p>Pause the playback and go to <strong>Playback</strong> &gt; <strong>Speed</strong> as explained in the previous step. From the list that comes up, click <strong>Slower</strong> (the last option). This will reduce the speed to 0.67x. Click <strong>Slower</strong> again and the speed will further go down to 0.50x. You can repeat this process until you reach your desired playback speed. Press <strong>Spacebar</strong> to resume the playback in slow motion. With this method, you can reduce the speed to as low as 0.02x.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can click <strong>Normal</strong> from the <strong>Speed</strong> submenu to play the video at normal speed.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Using the Shortcut Keys (Optional)</strong></p>
<p>You can press the left square bracket ‘<strong>[</strong>‘ on your keyboard to reduce the speed in decrements of 0.10x. To get back to the normal speed, press the equals to ‘<strong>=</strong>’ key. Likewise, pressing the right square bracket ‘<strong>]</strong>’ increases the speed by 0.10x.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> As it is with the <strong>Slower (fine)</strong> and <strong>Slower</strong> options, you can use <strong>Faster (fine)</strong> to add 0.10x increments to the speed, and <strong>Faster</strong> to increase percentage-wise. Also, if <strong>Faster (fine)</strong> is clicked repeatedly or its shortcut key is used multiple times, the speed can be increased up to 31.25x. On the other hand, by using the <strong>Faster</strong> option repeatedly, the speed can be increased to more than 100x.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>It is pretty convenient to reduce the playback speed in VLC media player regardless of the platform or device you are using. While the processes of getting the job might be different, the principle behind it remains the same. When on Windows, the playback speed can be decreased to 0.02x and can be increased to more than 100x. This facility is not available on Mac, iOS, or Android platforms. Also, if you want, you can set the default playback speed for the videos so that every time a clip is played, the pace remains what you specified as default.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>It is pretty convenient to reduce the playback speed in VLC media player regardless of the platform or device you are using. While the processes of getting the job might be different, the principle behind it remains the same. When on Windows, the playback speed can be decreased to 0.02x and can be increased to more than 100x. This facility is not available on Mac, iOS, or Android platforms. Also, if you want, you can set the default playback speed for the videos so that every time a clip is played, the pace remains what you specified as default.</p>

Then you can apply more than one-speed effect simultaneously. The speed can be toggled between real-time and half-speed slow motion. You can also add freeze frames for a specified period of time.</p>
<h3 id="6-GoPro-Exclusive-filters-2"><a href="#6-GoPro-Exclusive-filters-2" class="headerlink" title="6.GoPro-Exclusive filters"></a>6.GoPro-Exclusive filters</h3><p>From Media or Mural, select a photo or video and tap the pencil. In order to optimize the footage to the environment it was shot in, GoPro has created 25 filters in-house. By using the scrub bar, you can adjust the intensity of each filter.</p>
<h3 id="7-Premium-Themes-2"><a href="#7-Premium-Themes-2" class="headerlink" title="7.Premium Themes"></a>7.Premium Themes</h3><p>Alternatively, you may create a new highlight from Media. You will be presented with 13 video editing themes. Besides adding text and transitions, you can also change the music, choose the duration, and choose the right format for your intended sharing platform, such as social media or text.</p>
<h5 id="Pros-2"><a href="#Pros-2" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Despite its ease and quickness, there are a few drawbacks to it. First, I must say this is awesome and perfect for anyone who has never edited a GoPro video before. When you’re new to video editing software, it can be very easy to become frustrated and overwhelmed, so it’s great for those who aren’t familiar with it. It’s all about getting that video off your memory card and putting it out there. That’s it.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-2"><a href="#Cons-2" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>You cannot edit footage from your phone or DSLR with Quik App for Desktop - only GoPro footage can be used in Quik App. This is a GoPro app, after all. It should be used with GoPro content!</p>
<p>In addition to the ten free songs, GoPro Plus members have access to an additional song library. Users cannot import their own music either.</p>
<p>Additionally, you may only create a certain number of Highlights. Each 30-second video is limited to 10 Highlights.</p>
<h2 id="Final-Verdict-2"><a href="#Final-Verdict-2" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a>Final Verdict</h2><p>Although GoPro Quik is amazing and comes with a lot of features, there are still many limitations of this application, as discussed in the cons section of this article. If you want to do basic editing, then this app will do just good, but if you are looking for advanced features like audio normalization, keyframing, color tuning, gif support, etc., then you will have to use another fully-fledged video editing app. We recommend you to give a try to our <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> video editor.</p>
