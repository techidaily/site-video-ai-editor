<p>MP4 files were executed under the ISO&#x2F;IEC 14496-12:2001 standard by the IEC&#x2F;ISO and Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG). MP4 is an international specification for audio-visual coding only because of this.</p>
<p>The high degree of compression used in MP4 videos assists the files to be much smaller in size than other video formats. Minimizing the file size doesn’t suddenly affect the file quality, either. Almost the entire original quality retains, making MP4 a web-friendly and portable video format.</p>
<p>They shouldn’t be confused with M4A and MP3, while MP4 files can play audio.</p>
<p>It can also help to store the other kinds of data files, such as different subtitles and still images.</p>
<p>This media container allows a blend of video, audio, subtitles, and still images to be present only in a single file. It also assists in storing advanced content like 3D Graphics, interactivity of the menus, and the users. This tool is highly accessible, and everyone can use it with simplicity.</p>
<h3 id="02Pros-and-Cons-of-the-MP4-format"><a href="#02Pros-and-Cons-of-the-MP4-format" class="headerlink" title="02Pros and Cons of the MP4 format"></a>02<strong>Pros and Cons of the MP4 format</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros of the MP4 format</strong></p>
<p>One of the critical merits of the MP4 format is that it can be valuable on different platforms.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It consists of a high degree of compression while producing smaller file sizes, making it a perfect fit for compressing or video streaming HD audio-video files.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> An MP4 file can contain metadata and Extensible Meta Data Platform such as images based on PNG or JPEG format, subtitles, among others, and PDF.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Compatible with metadata integrable with 3D graphics, user navigation or menus options, and other user interaction features.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are numerous open-source players, such as VLC Media Player, that offer full format support, even used on Linux OS.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is also versatile. For example, audio files coded with the M4A extension and MPEG-4 visual bitstreams encoded in the M4V extension.</p>
<p><strong>Cons of the MP4 format</strong></p>
<p>Note that the format is a container. This means that instead of storing the ode for the file, it keeps the data. Moreover, a specific MP4 file is based upon particular codecs because it does not have a native way of managing the involved coding.</p>
<p>A possible drawback is that there are hundreds of codecs available. Therefore, a media player must run a set of codecs concerning a particular MP4 file.</p>
<p>Yet, because the container format has become widely used, widely-supported codecs have become standards.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Audio can drift out of the way or connect with the video in specific scenarios because of codec-player or codecs compatibility issues.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Because a single file can contain video and audio and different metadata, editing or playback or editing needs various computing resources.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is still a lossy format. A higher compression format and smaller file size would result in audio and video quality losses.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The familiarity of the MP4 format, coupled with its portability, has also enabled the illegal distribution of copyrighted audio-video files.</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/solution-for-choosing-fast-youtube-to-mp4-video-converter-02.jpg"
                      alt="mp4 format"

<p>MP4 files were executed under the ISO&#x2F;IEC 14496-12:2001 standard by the IEC&#x2F;ISO and Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG). MP4 is an international specification for audio-visual coding only because of this.</p>
<p>The high degree of compression used in MP4 videos assists the files to be much smaller in size than other video formats. Minimizing the file size doesn’t suddenly affect the file quality, either. Almost the entire original quality retains, making MP4 a web-friendly and portable video format.</p>
<p>They shouldn’t be confused with M4A and MP3, while MP4 files can play audio.</p>
<p>It can also help to store the other kinds of data files, such as different subtitles and still images.</p>
<p>This media container allows a blend of video, audio, subtitles, and still images to be present only in a single file. It also assists in storing advanced content like 3D Graphics, interactivity of the menus, and the users. This tool is highly accessible, and everyone can use it with simplicity.</p>
<h3 id="02Pros-and-Cons-of-the-MP4-format-1"><a href="#02Pros-and-Cons-of-the-MP4-format-1" class="headerlink" title="02Pros and Cons of the MP4 format"></a>02<strong>Pros and Cons of the MP4 format</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros of the MP4 format</strong></p>
<p>One of the critical merits of the MP4 format is that it can be valuable on different platforms.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It consists of a high degree of compression while producing smaller file sizes, making it a perfect fit for compressing or video streaming HD audio-video files.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> An MP4 file can contain metadata and Extensible Meta Data Platform such as images based on PNG or JPEG format, subtitles, among others, and PDF.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Compatible with metadata integrable with 3D graphics, user navigation or menus options, and other user interaction features.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are numerous open-source players, such as VLC Media Player, that offer full format support, even used on Linux OS.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is also versatile. For example, audio files coded with the M4A extension and MPEG-4 visual bitstreams encoded in the M4V extension.</p>
<p><strong>Cons of the MP4 format</strong></p>
<p>Note that the format is a container. This means that instead of storing the ode for the file, it keeps the data. Moreover, a specific MP4 file is based upon particular codecs because it does not have a native way of managing the involved coding.</p>
<p>A possible drawback is that there are hundreds of codecs available. Therefore, a media player must run a set of codecs concerning a particular MP4 file.</p>
<p>Yet, because the container format has become widely used, widely-supported codecs have become standards.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Audio can drift out of the way or connect with the video in specific scenarios because of codec-player or codecs compatibility issues.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Because a single file can contain video and audio and different metadata, editing or playback or editing needs various computing resources.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is still a lossy format. A higher compression format and smaller file size would result in audio and video quality losses.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The familiarity of the MP4 format, coupled with its portability, has also enabled the illegal distribution of copyrighted audio-video files.</p>

<p>One of the critical merits of the MP4 format is that it can be valuable on different platforms.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It consists of a high degree of compression while producing smaller file sizes, making it a perfect fit for compressing or video streaming HD audio-video files.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> An MP4 file can contain metadata and Extensible Meta Data Platform such as images based on PNG or JPEG format, subtitles, among others, and PDF.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Compatible with metadata integrable with 3D graphics, user navigation or menus options, and other user interaction features.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are numerous open-source players, such as VLC Media Player, that offer full format support, even used on Linux OS.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is also versatile. For example, audio files coded with the M4A extension and MPEG-4 visual bitstreams encoded in the M4V extension.</p>
<p><strong>Cons of the MP4 format</strong></p>
<p>Note that the format is a container. This means that instead of storing the ode for the file, it keeps the data. Moreover, a specific MP4 file is based upon particular codecs because it does not have a native way of managing the involved coding.</p>
<p>A possible drawback is that there are hundreds of codecs available. Therefore, a media player must run a set of codecs concerning a particular MP4 file.</p>
<p>Yet, because the container format has become widely used, widely-supported codecs have become standards.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Audio can drift out of the way or connect with the video in specific scenarios because of codec-player or codecs compatibility issues.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Because a single file can contain video and audio and different metadata, editing or playback or editing needs various computing resources.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is still a lossy format. A higher compression format and smaller file size would result in audio and video quality losses.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The familiarity of the MP4 format, coupled with its portability, has also enabled the illegal distribution of copyrighted audio-video files.</p>

Let’s take a closer look at what they have to offer.</p>
<h4 id="2-BeFunky"><a href="#2-BeFunky" class="headerlink" title="2. BeFunky"></a>2. BeFunky</h4><p>Befunky is one of the best photo editors you can find online, which is why it is hardly surprising that it offers cartoonization effects. In fact, you can choose from <strong>five different cartoonization effects</strong> that are all equally impressive.</p>
<p>All of the cartoon effects Befunky has to offer are located in the Artsy menu, and you just have to click on Cartoonizer DLX, Cross Hatch DLX, Pop Art DLX, or Graphic Novel DLX effects in order to apply them to your photo. Furthermore, you can use the Erase mode if you don’t want to catoonize the entire photo or head over to the Adjust menu to specify the amount of the effect you’ll apply and increase or decrease the photo’s sharpness.</p>
<p>Go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.befunky.com/features/photo-to-cartoon/" >https://www.befunky.com/features/photo-to-cartoon/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and you can then turn your photos to cartoon easily in BeFunky.</p>

Lunapic</h4><p>This is yet another online photo editing platform that gives you access to a broad range of photo editing options for free. Even though a bit outdated, the Lunapic’s interface resembles Photoshop’s interface, so you won’t need much time to get used to it if you ever used Adobe’s iconic photo editing software.</p>
<p>Once you’ve uploaded a photo, you just have to go to the Effects menu and select the Cartoon option. Lunapic will then automatically apply the effect to the photo you uploaded and you just need to preview the image before you save it. The only downside is that you can’t adjust the effect’s settings in case you don’t like the results.</p>

<p>Did you know your Mac device comes with a built-in speech-to-text feature? So whether you use a laptop or desktop, you can generate text from your voice through your device’s microphone. Officially known as Dictation, the app allows you to transcribe text anywhere you can type it. So, for example, you can use Apple Dictation for your messaging and word processing apps.</p>
<p>The feature has been available since macOS Sierra as a free built-in feature. Earlier versions of Apple Dictation relied on its voice recognition software. However, it now relies on Siri for users of macOS Catalina onwards.</p>
<p>Typically, the app allows you to transcribe thirty seconds and below of audio. However, you can enable Enhanced dictation for longer transcription times. According to most users, the app is suitable for getting the first draft of your assignment, which you can manually edit later.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to enable Apple Dictation on your Mac:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tap the Apple logo on the top-left toolbar of your screen and select <strong>System Preferences</strong> from the resulting menu.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Keyboard</strong> option from the system preferences screen.</li>
<li>Once there, click on the <strong>Dictation</strong> option located at the top of the menu.</li>
<li>Select <strong>On</strong> to activate the app in its default mode. In addition, you can check the <strong>Use Enhanced Dictation</strong> box to enable additional functions such as offline use and text commands like bold and italics.</li>
<li>Finally, select your language from the dropdown menu and choose a shortcut key.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that you need to speak your punctuation loudly when using Apple Dictation. Otherwise, the app will consider them as regular words.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Another option to consider is speech-to-text Microsoft Word Mac. The app is free to use and relies on Microsoft Azure Speech Services to transcribe text. Below are the requirements to use speech-to-text word mac.</p>
<ul>
<li>An external microphone for your Mac desktop, or you can use your built-in microphone for your MacBook. This is because speech-to-text on Microsoft word mac only allows input with a microphone rather than an audio file upload.</li>
<li>An active Office 365 subscription. Please note you need to log in to your account for the app to function.</li>
<li>Insider builds 16.32 (19120802) and above.</li>
<li>An active internet connection.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have everything set up, follow these steps to use speech-to-text on Word.</p>
<ol>
<li>Launch Microsoft Word from your desktop.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Dictate</strong> button from the top menu of your Word document, and wait for the red dot to appear. The button features a microphone for easy identification.</li>
<li>Once the dot appears, start speaking to transcribe your text. Ensure you are in a quiet environment for the best results. In addition, speak louder when transcribing punctuations.</li>
<li>Click on the Dictate button to finish the transcription.</li>

<p>Dragon Dictate is arguably the best dictation software currently on the market. According to most users, its accuracy and feature sets are next to none. For example, the Smart Format Rules learn how you represent dates, numbers, and abbreviations, resulting in less editing work for you. The Dragon Dictate app is free to download from the Apple Store.</p>
<p>Dragon for Mac users reports a dictation accuracy of nearly 99%, which is excellent in the speech-to-text software category. All of Nuance’s Dragon products use deep learning technology to capture your accent and cadence. As such, the app gets better at transcribing your text as you continue using it. In addition, dragon for Mac professional allows you to transcribe audio clips from uploaded files. For example, you can import audio from your iPhone to your Dragon Dictate workspace and transcribe it hassle-free.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you cannot get a stand-alone dragon app for Mac. This is because Nuance discontinued its development in 2018. In addition, Microsoft’s acquisition of the company in 2021 proves that the decision is permanent. However, you can still use the Windows version of Dragon through Parallels, which allows you to run macOS and Windows simultaneously. In addition, this method also works for M1 Macs.</p>

This is because the microphone is much closer to your mouth, so your voice is less affected by external noise.</p>

Apps such as Google’s Speech to Text include a translation feature in their functionality. However, you will need the Google Chrome browser to access Speech to text. This is because the service is only available to active google account holders.</p>
<h3 id="How-much-faster-is-speech-to-text-faster-than-typing-1"><a href="#How-much-faster-is-speech-to-text-faster-than-typing-1" class="headerlink" title="How much faster is speech to text faster than typing?"></a>How much faster is speech to text faster than typing?</h3><p>A 2017 Stanford study states that speech to text is about<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3161187" >three times faster than typing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. In addition, it found that speech-to-text apps can transcribe over 150 words per minute, while professional transcriptionists range between 50 to 80 words per minute.</p>
