**No 2\. VLC - Open-source Network Stream Player**

VLC media player must be the leader in the streaming player world. In addition to a RTSP player, VLC is also capable of analyzing and playing HTTP, RTP, MMS and HLS streams. For offline media streaming, VLC is similar to 5KPlayer to provide a DLNA function for multi-screen sharing. Besides, [VLC AirPlay](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) function is also under active development to Apple users. Speaking of local media files, VLC media player is also an ideal choice since it has a lot of tweaks and settings for users to customize.

**No 3\. FFmpeg - An Open-source Project Can Access RTSP Stream**

FFmpeg is not a media player, actually, it is a powerful, free and open-source project for handling video, audio, and other multimedia files and streams. Some of the core algorithms of VLC, YouTube, iTunes, etc. are based on the workflow of this program. It is fast to access RTSP, RTMP, HTTP, HLS, etc stream but it is very complex to set up and use.

**No 4\. Megacubo - A Free, Simple and Intuitive IPTV Player**
