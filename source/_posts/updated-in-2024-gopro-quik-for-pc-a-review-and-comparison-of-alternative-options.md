## **GoPro Quik PC- An Overview**

Do you need an app for editing GoPro videos and photos? If the answer is yes, then you should go for GoPro Quik for Desktop. GoPro Quik is a video editing software that allows you to edit your GoPro videos and photos within no time. The app comes with a very simple user interface that will help you quickly edit your videos. GoPro Quik for desktop was created to meet your basic needs and wants when it comes to editing GoPro photos and videos. You can easily edit your GoPro photos and videos using this app. This app will help you in creating post-production videos like a pro.

The best thing about GoPro Quick for Desktop is that it is free to use and is available easily for both 32 bit and 64 bit systems. It also has a simple and intuitive interface that anyone can adopt, even if you don't have any prior experience with this video editing app. It basically allows you to import your GoPro clips, highlight your favorite clips, and then it edits your video for you–including adding music. The process is pretty quick, as the name suggests.

## **GoPro Quik Windows Features**

GoPro Quik app is rich with features, and it provides pretty much everything that you need to create amazing photos and videos. A few highlighting features are discussed below:

### 1.Create Amazing Videos In Just A Few Clicks

With GoPro Quik, making amazing videos is very easy. With just a few clicks, you can import all your videos and photos. Then you can edit them in just a few clicks. Everything here is so simple that you will feel like a pro video editor yourself.

### 2.Auto Cloud Uploads

Another amazing feature of GoPro Quik is that once you have done editing your videos, they will be automatically uploaded to your cloud. But for this feature to work, make sure that you have an active GoPro PLUS subscription.

### 3.Excellent editing

Simply click a few buttons to turn GoPro footage into an awesome video. Pick the perfect soundtrack, then pick your favorite moments. Your video automatically syncs with the music, so you can share it in just a few seconds. Make your videos come alive with panning effects by adding photos and time-lapse sequences.

### 4.Share with friends

Make short videos that are ideal for posting on Facebook, YouTube, and more. Make a unique video from your burst and timelapse photos. Additionally, you can find and save the most memorable moments in a video, then share them as high-quality still images.

### 5.New Speed Tool

Tap the pencil to choose the Speed icon for the video in your Media Mural. Then you can apply more than one-speed effect simultaneously. The speed can be toggled between real-time and half-speed slow motion. You can also add freeze frames for a specified period of time.

### 6.GoPro-Exclusive filters

From Media or Mural, select a photo or video and tap the pencil. In order to optimize the footage to the environment it was shot in, GoPro has created 25 filters in-house. By using the scrub bar, you can adjust the intensity of each filter.

### 7.Premium Themes

Alternatively, you may create a new highlight from Media. You will be presented with 13 video editing themes. Besides adding text and transitions, you can also change the music, choose the duration, and choose the right format for your intended sharing platform, such as social media or text.

##### Pros

Despite its ease and quickness, there are a few drawbacks to it. First, I must say this is awesome and perfect for anyone who has never edited a GoPro video before. When you're new to video editing software, it can be very easy to become frustrated and overwhelmed, so it's great for those who aren't familiar with it. It's all about getting that video off your memory card and putting it out there. That's it.

##### Cons

You cannot edit footage from your phone or DSLR with Quik App for Desktop - only GoPro footage can be used in Quik App. This is a GoPro app, after all. It should be used with GoPro content!

In addition to the ten free songs, GoPro Plus members have access to an additional song library. Users cannot import their own music either.

Additionally, you may only create a certain number of Highlights. Each 30-second video is limited to 10 Highlights.

## Final Verdict

Although GoPro Quik is amazing and comes with a lot of features, there are still many limitations of this application, as discussed in the cons section of this article. If you want to do basic editing, then this app will do just good, but if you are looking for advanced features like audio normalization, keyframing, color tuning, gif support, etc., then you will have to use another fully-fledged video editing app. We recommend you to give a try to our [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) video editor.

Filmora comes with plenty of features and can easily compete with the most advanced video editors in the world. The best thing is, you can download and install it for free and try all of its features without paying a penny. Also, there is an amazing community and Filmora support that you won’t find anywhere else.

Among the many reasons for plugin malfunction, one of the most common ones in incorrect or bad code. After all, nobody is protected from rookie developers as they can come with strange codes, causing plugin crashing problems. It is not the user’s mistake if the code is incorrect. Therefore, you should simply consider taking advice from the help center of the plugin site or ask any of their experts to settle the matter.

In addition to this, the plugins are constantly updating by the developers therefore users willing to install the latest plugins should first see whether the plugin is compatible with their Final Cut Pro X version or not. If you do not have the latest version of the software, there are chances that the plugin can crash. You should then consider contacting the expert or simply installing the latest version of the plugin that is best supported by the Final Cut Pro X.

![color-finale-2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/top-10-free-fcpx-plugins-color-finale-2.jpg)

Fortunately, there are easy ways to fix the problem when they are not properly working inside the Final Cut Pro X. Generally, the issue can be fixed by simply updating and re-installing the plugin in your system but if that does not work, consider the below checklist of the elements you should consider fixing the problems related to the generators, effects, transitions, and titles inside the Final Cut Pro X.

* **Searching on the Correct Part** \- When looking for the plugin, you should always ensure looking for it in the correct part of the Final Cut Pro X. For instance, if you are looking for the effects, make sure that you are checking them in the effects panel.
* **Proper Installation** \- The next tip that you must consider is the correct and proper installation of the plugin. You should follow the steps of the plugin installation in order to avoid incorrect installation in your Final Cut Pro X.
* **Localization of the Folders** \- Now comes the localization of the folders meaning their placement. You should ensure keeping your motion effects, templates, generators, transitions, and titles folders localized.
* **Placement of the Effects and Transitions** \- While placing your titles and generators, you should ensure that they go on the top of your timeline however the transitions can go in between the two clips on the timeline and the effects can be dropped directly into the video clip.
* **Delete the Plugin from Everywhere** \- You should always consider deleting the plugin from everywhere in your system if it continues to trouble you. Delete it from the finder and trash folders, then re-download, re-install and restart your system.
* **Seek Help from the Plugin Creator** \- If none of the aforementioned tips helps, you should definitely turn to the service provider or the plugin creator who can offer you their expert assistance.

All those video editors who are specifically getting a red warning error sign inside the Final Cut Pro X software should understand that there is a problem with the actual file instead of the plugin. So, try fixing that in the first place.

## Part 2: Edit Video on Desktop with Filmora

The reason [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the most recommended tool (and even our favorite) is its attractive feature-set and cost-effective pricing. Available for both macOS and Windows, Wondershare’s Filmora is the best software if you are looking for a computer tool for HD video editing.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## Part 3: FAQ

**Is the New M1 iPad Pro Good for Video Editing?**

Like most Apple products, the iPad Pro exterior hasn’t changed much compared to its predecessors, as the real magical upgrades are inside. The new M1 chip, the magnificent XDR display, 120Hz Refresh Rate, unbelievable Performance, Magic Keyboard, Thunderbolt 3, and USB 4 is enough to recognize the latest iPad Pro as the most powerful tablet ever made that can do everything that a Laptop can! Other hallmarks like the trackpad and magnetic slide — make it the perfect substitute for anyone looking to replace their laptop with an iPad Pro for video editing.

## Part4: Conclusion

Touch screens can be difficult to handle when performing precise operations like video-editing; that is why it is critical to use only the best video-editors on iPad.

Editor’s choice: Filmora. Reason: suitable for beginners and intuitive interface.

## Part 1: 5 Best Video Editing Apps for iPad

### 1\. Filmora (Recommended)

Available for iOS (i.e., for iPad) and Android users, [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the most viable option if you want to take your videos to the next level from your mobile screens. The easy-to-use interface allows even the naivest users to adapt the video skills quickly plus it being easy-on-eyes also enables you to edit videos seamlessly. Given the dedicated options for everything — tripping & cutting videos to adding audio, photos, and subtitles — editing videos will not take time.

[![Download filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/google_play.jpg) ](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6) [![Download filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/apple_store.jpg)](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6)

**Pros:**

* New upgrades have brought Advanced Crop features
* You can set duration of video motion
* Filmora includes all the basic video-editing features you might expect, like cutting, merging, cropping, and rotating video footage

**Cons:**

* Filmora does have a free version, but the video will be watermarked

**Price:**

**Free version available**

Filmora Pro (1 Year) — $32.99

Filmora Pro （1 Month） — $6.99

Remove Logo Roll — $4.99more

### 2\. LumaFusion (best for iPad)

Recommended for iPad users, LumaFusion is a multitrack mobile video editor used by professionals. However, unlike Filmora, LumaFusion does not make it simple for an average Joe to utilize the application to its full extent. In fact, LumaFusion recommends video tutorials if you are a beginner to video-editing. Nevertheless, when it comes to feature-set, LumaFusion has one of the most advanced libraries of features that allows you to tell compelling video stories.

**Pros:**

* Uncluttered, intuitive, and customizable user interface
* Advanced and adjustable image stabilizer
* Simple color correction — you do not have to fret with color wheels, video scopes, auto white balance, nodes, or any settings; instead, it includes a handful of color presets and sliders to make the process more convenient.
* Edit up to six layers of audio and video
* Supports all major video formats and more!

**Cons:**

* No android app available yet
* Not friendly for beginners
* No free version

**Price:** US$ 29.99, extra subscription for Storyblocks needed

### 3\. iMovie

Suitable for beginners, iMovie's main aim is to provide ease of use in a clean and elegant interface. In all, you will not find advanced video-editing options. But when it comes to basic features like tripping, cutting, adding audio, subtitles, and transition effects — iMovie is second to no one in terms of usability.

**Pros:**

* Cross-platform apps for all Apple devices
* Features like the Trailer timeline make the whole process seamless
* Simple and easy-to-use interface — suitable for beginners
* Good range of fun templates
* Multiple audio-editing options
* Completely free to use

**Cons:**

* For the sake of simplicity, iMovie excludes some critical functions like motion-tracking and more.
* No advanced options like editing 360-degree video editing

**Price:** Free
