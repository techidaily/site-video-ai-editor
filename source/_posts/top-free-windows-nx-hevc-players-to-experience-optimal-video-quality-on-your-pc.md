## HEVC Video Extensions Windows 10 Download vs. HEVC Player Windows 10

Seldom playback of HEVC Windows 10 can get well addressed with a $0.99 HEVC video extension Windows 10 – available for purchase in Microsoft official website at: [HEVC video extension Windows buy link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/hevc-video-extensions/9nmzlz57r3t7?activetab=pivot:regionofsystemrequirementstab)

If your friend already had this HEVC Windows 10 extension before, which only started to cost from June 5, 2019, don't worry about the cost as there still is a free version available – only not ranking high among google searches – free HEVC Windows 10 video extension download is available through the link below, and the only difference between the free and paid version is that the latter supports software decoding of HEVC Windows 10\. [HEVC video extension Windows 10 free link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/hevc-video-extensions-from-device-manufacturer/9n4wgh0z6vhq?irgwc=1&OCID=AID681541%5Faff%5F7593%5F159229&tduid=%28ir%5F3O5x7y0ACTBq3Ct14UXmM2CEUkjQPgSNOToHQA0%29%287593%29%28159229%29%28%29%28UUwpUdUnU56397YYw%29&irclickid=3O5x7y0ACTBq3Ct14UXmM2CEUkjQPgSNOToHQA0)

To make it clearer: Installing both the 2 versions of HEVC Windows 10 video extension means you can play HEVC H.265 coded videos in 4K UHD resolutions everywhere on Windows 10 – including web-browsers, video players and etc. Both of them, like self-integrated HEVC player Windows 10 like 5KPlayer, invoke hardware capabilities of your Windows 10 computer to facilitate HEVC playback when available, and for PCs without such UHD video processing hardware unites like Intel QSV, NVIDIA CUDA graphic card, it helps HEVC H.265 videos to play, which otherwise won’t open at all.

That been said, the $0.99 HEVC Windows 10 video extension is an option worthy of consideration when you often use the computer to play short video clips encoded in HEVC 4K. But playing a feature-length movie in 4320p without a standalone HEVC video player Windows 10 often means the device gets burning hot. 

After the review of HEVC video extensions Windows 10, you may start to take a look at the free HEVC player - [5KPlayer](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/).
