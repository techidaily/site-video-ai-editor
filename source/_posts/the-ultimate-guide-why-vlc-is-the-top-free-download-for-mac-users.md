### Undesirables and Inconveniences of VLC Media Player for Mac

**Functional Inconveniences of VLC Media Player for Mac**:

**Version 3.0.12 VLC added support for M1 Mac, but problems also follow**

After using VLC on the new M1 Mac for a very short time, there are some complaints from users:  
_\- Closing VLC from dock often reports a failure and the program crashes_ 
 _\- Pressing escape while watching a video in full screen resulted in kernel panic crash and hard reboot of the macbook once (the first and only time i have ever had a crash on this machine)_ 
 _\- CPU load seems to be about the same or even higher than on the 3.0.11.1 x86 version via Rosetta_

However, there is no official solution as of now. You have to wait some time if you encounter the same problems.

**1\. VLC Media Player Mac broken in Mac OSX 10 and above like Mavericks 10.9.2, Yosemite etc. when you try to play MKV files!**  
Tons of users have already experienced the sudden non-responsive condition of VLC Media Player for Mac, and the reason is still under further investigation, but a possible reason for this may lay in the plug-in VLC uses according to VLC Forum, since VLC Mac requires certain plug-in to read MKV files and other file formats.  
5KPlayer, in this regard, designed for iMac, MacBook, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, Mac Mini or Mac Pro running OS X 10.7 or later, without any plug-in for varied file formats, plays MKV and [plays all the other video/music formats](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) like MP4, MOV, AVI, FLV, MP3, etc. effortlessly and smoothly on Mac Mavericks 10.9.2 and Yosemite.

It is simple in operations, smooth in streaming and quick in process. 

**3\. VLC Media Player for Mac Suffers Cockamamie and Fussy Download/Converting Procedures**   
Although VLC Mac is capable of downloading files from online websites and converting them into target formats, the process can be quite cumbersome. For example, it takes 12 steps to simply download a short MPEG-4 video and 5 steps to convert it to a MP4 (H264) file. The tricky and overly complicated options really annoy users in the course of getting what they want. 

 **4\. VLC Media Player Mac Affected by Security Vulnerability**  
 This is a security issue that we should be altered using VLC for Mac and Windows as well. Malware attack loop holes have been back then detected in subtitles, DEP access violation vulnerability, a write access flaw, and today's LIVE555 RTSP server. The security issue of an open source media player is unavoidable, but we can always do an update.
