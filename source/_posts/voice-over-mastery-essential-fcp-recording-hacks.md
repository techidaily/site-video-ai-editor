Most of you might be interested to know how to record voice with Final Cut Pro. Actually, the method is quite simple and can be used by beginners too.

**What is Audition in FCP:**

The term auditions are commonly used on FCP platform that represents sets of some related clips out of which you have to select anyone for your final project. Users are allowed to take multiple inputs of different clips for the composition of the audition and the other interesting task is to apply different effects on the same clip to create an audition with multiple versions.

You can easily find created auditions in the top left corner of your timeline as well as on the browser.

## Part 3: What are the limitations when using Sony Vegas (Vegas Pro) on Mac?

Yes, with the given **Sony Vegas alternatives, Mac** and Windows users can benefit heavily. But why is it important to try for a replacement when Sony Vegas Pro is relatively efficient software?

To know the answer, you should take the time to understand its limitations, which do exist.

#### **It only works for Windows users**

The Sony Vegas Pro software is not available for Mac or other operating systems besides Windows. In addition, it’ll be really complex and time-consuming, even if you opt for virtual machine software or handle dual booting techniques to configure the software on your Mac or Linux.

#### **You need to invest in other hardware**

Sony Vegas Pro does do not work within one comprehensive platform like other capable video editing software types, like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You have to acquire a powerful PC and tools to operate it separately. The software works very slowly on older devices.

#### **Not incredibly unique**

The functions of Sony Vegas Pro match somewhat with other options in the market. So, users would not expect much value in purchasing this software’s plans that they want to upgrade from their previous system, but on the other hand, the available features are mostly standard-level in functionality as well.

## Hot FAQs about Vegas Pro Alternatives

After knowing these details, many users still have specific common queries about opting for a Sony Vegas Pro alternatively. So these are some common FAQs about this- answered.

#### 1\. Can Sony Vegas be used on a Mac?

No, it is impossible to directly use Sony Vegas on macOS devices since it does not support it. Instead, you have to separately use a dual boot strategy or virtual machine software to activate the video editor on Mac devices, but the process for that is complex.

#### 2\. Is Wondershare Filmora or Vegas Pro better?

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Vegas Pro are top-level options in video and audio editing projects with professional-level editing accuracy. However, Filmora has a cohesive ecosystem with rich AI and standard functions and comes with Mac/Windows support. So, in that sense, Filmora is comparatively a better choice.

## Final Words

In place of Sony Vegas Pro, any of these options would also give you a great user experience. Out of them, [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is one that we will recommend due to its multi-faceted benefits and features for Mac and Windows users. Ultimately, make your decision based on your particular needs.

## Part 3: What are the limitations when using Sony Vegas (Vegas Pro) on Mac?

Yes, with the given **Sony Vegas alternatives, Mac** and Windows users can benefit heavily. But why is it important to try for a replacement when Sony Vegas Pro is relatively efficient software?

To know the answer, you should take the time to understand its limitations, which do exist.

#### **It only works for Windows users**

The Sony Vegas Pro software is not available for Mac or other operating systems besides Windows. In addition, it’ll be really complex and time-consuming, even if you opt for virtual machine software or handle dual booting techniques to configure the software on your Mac or Linux.

#### **You need to invest in other hardware**

Sony Vegas Pro does do not work within one comprehensive platform like other capable video editing software types, like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You have to acquire a powerful PC and tools to operate it separately. The software works very slowly on older devices.

#### **Not incredibly unique**

The functions of Sony Vegas Pro match somewhat with other options in the market. So, users would not expect much value in purchasing this software’s plans that they want to upgrade from their previous system, but on the other hand, the available features are mostly standard-level in functionality as well.

## Hot FAQs about Vegas Pro Alternatives

After knowing these details, many users still have specific common queries about opting for a Sony Vegas Pro alternatively. So these are some common FAQs about this- answered.

#### 1\. Can Sony Vegas be used on a Mac?

No, it is impossible to directly use Sony Vegas on macOS devices since it does not support it. Instead, you have to separately use a dual boot strategy or virtual machine software to activate the video editor on Mac devices, but the process for that is complex.

#### 2\. Is Wondershare Filmora or Vegas Pro better?

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Vegas Pro are top-level options in video and audio editing projects with professional-level editing accuracy. However, Filmora has a cohesive ecosystem with rich AI and standard functions and comes with Mac/Windows support. So, in that sense, Filmora is comparatively a better choice.

## Final Words

In place of Sony Vegas Pro, any of these options would also give you a great user experience. Out of them, [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is one that we will recommend due to its multi-faceted benefits and features for Mac and Windows users. Ultimately, make your decision based on your particular needs.

All you need right now is a good computer system and bingo you are a video editor.

If you’re an experienced [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), then check our picks of the best professional video editing software.

Personally, I don’t recommend using online tools since sometimes the network connection isn’t good, and when there is a network error, all the efforts are gone. Editing videos with online tools also need high upload and download speed, so it’s suitable for editing short and small size video clips. Besides, online video editing solutions maybe not the best choice if you need more advanced editing options and beautiful video effects.

It can be used on Mac and Windows computers both and is suitable for beginners and semi-pros both.

It seems that Wideo only allows you to **upload your own images** in .jpg, .png and .gif and backgrounds or music, I didn’t find out a way to add my own video footage to this online video editor. Let me know if you have any clue.

What I like about Wideo is that it allows you to choose **video aspect ratio** such as 16:9, 1:1, and 9;16, and there are **a lot of video templates** available, although most of them need to pay. It also provides a 7 -day trial, and the paid versions cost from 19/mo to 79/mo.

However, if you want to **download** the video on your computer, you’ll **need to upgrade your plan**. If you want to use your own footage and save the edited videos on your desk, Wideo isn't a free option for you.

### #12\. Online Video Cutter

![online video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Though it isn't a video editor to some degree, this intuitive online video editing tool application appears user-friendly and it isn’t limited to cut videos as the name indicates.

#### 1\. Is There Any Online Video Editor No Watermark?

Yes, there are some free online video editors without watermarks, such as ClipChamp, Online Video Cutter and Hippo Video after exporting. But you should note that in some online video editing tool, the video resolution may be limited to 480p in the free plan.

While, free online video editors like Clip Champ didn't watermark your video but the quality is limited to 480P. Video Toolbox can remain the original quality and keeps no watermark, but the interface isn't intuitive. The rising star Kapwing will be a good choice if you don't need many editing features.

#### 2\. Is There Any Online Video Maker With Music And Pictures?

For those who want to use the music and pictures from the online video maker, I recommend you try Magisto and Kizoa. From the description of these two editors, you can see they are a perfect match.

 **Conclusion**

Above are some free online video makers that you can use right in your browser on both Windows, Mac, Linux or mobile devices if you like. Most of these online video makers are beginners friendly and easy to use since they provide simple editing features. But some of them may need you to register first to use the online video editing tools, and some may leave a braning watermark in the free version.

However, Filmora is one of the easiest-to-use home video editing software with special editing features lets you seamlessly stitch together video clips, music & text, apply effects and get a professional-looking home movie in minutes. All classic video editing functions such as trim, crop, zoom, cut, split as well as stunning video effects (PIP, Green Screen, Faceo-off, etc) are provided. Up to 100 audio and video tracks to use.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

With the creation of social video sharing networks online like YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram and Vine, editing and making videos stopped being the exclusive domain of professionals. All you need right now is a good computer system and bingo you are a video editor. You can now edit videos online without downloading any program on your Windows or Mac computer - all you require is a decent network connection to the internet. In this article, we are going to talk about the top 10 most recommended best free online video editing solutions that you can access online.

Most of these free online video editors are beginner-friendly, so even if you just come to the video editing world, you can make a video quickly with these online video editing tools. If you’re an experienced [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), then check our picks of the best professional video editing software.

Personally, I don’t recommend using online tools since sometimes the network connection isn’t good, and when there is a network error, all the efforts are gone. Editing videos with online tools also need high upload and download speed, so it’s suitable for editing short and small size video clips. Besides, online video editing solutions maybe not the best choice if you need more advanced editing options and beautiful video effects. In this case, I highly recommend Wondershare Filmora for the tool you can't miss. Just download it to have a try to explore the editing features, plentiful effects and presets. It can be used on Mac and Windows computers both and is suitable for beginners and semi-pros both.

Note: in the free trial version of Filmora 11, there will be a watermark like most online video editors listed below. But you’re allowed to use all the features and effects and save it to your computer or share it on YouTube or Vimeo directly. If you’re a teacher or a student or school staff, you can enjoy our [discount](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on purchasing.

I’m not sure what the problem is, but when I added the audio to the video and play it back, it didn’t go smooth. Let me know if you’ve met the same issue when using it in the comment below.

### #12\. Online Video Cutter

![online video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Though it isn't a video editor to some degree, this intuitive online video editing tool application appears user-friendly and it isn’t limited to cut videos as the name indicates. You can upload videos from computer or via Dropbox, Google Drive or URL directly. With this online video cutter, you can easily **rotate** the videos to 90, 180 or even 270 degrees, **crop** them, **trim** or apply several professional style editing features to create incredible projects. You can **save the video with the original quality or to 1080P Full HD**.

It can easily handle the **maximum file size of 500MB** and allow users to access any popular media file format with ease. It is free to use and you can access all advanced features even without buying any license.

What I like about this online video editing tool is that **you don’t need to register to use** it and there is also **no watermark** in the saved video. But it would be greater if this online tool can integrate some music and effects as well.

#### 1\. Is There Any Online Video Editor No Watermark?

Yes, there are some free online video editors without watermarks, such as ClipChamp, Online Video Cutter and Hippo Video after exporting. But you should note that in some online video editing tool, the video resolution may be limited to 480p in the free plan.

While, free online video editors like Clip Champ didn't watermark your video but the quality is limited to 480P. Video Toolbox can remain the original quality and keeps no watermark, but the interface isn't intuitive. The rising star Kapwing will be a good choice if you don't need many editing features.

#### 2\. Is There Any Online Video Maker With Music And Pictures?

For those who want to use the music and pictures from the online video maker, I recommend you try Magisto and Kizoa. From the description of these two editors, you can see they are a perfect match.

 **Conclusion**

Above are some free online video makers that you can use right in your browser on both Windows, Mac, Linux or mobile devices if you like. Most of these online video makers are beginners friendly and easy to use since they provide simple editing features. But some of them may need you to register first to use the online video editing tools, and some may leave a braning watermark in the free version.

However, Filmora is one of the easiest-to-use home video editing software with special editing features lets you seamlessly stitch together video clips, music & text, apply effects and get a professional-looking home movie in minutes. All classic video editing functions such as trim, crop, zoom, cut, split as well as stunning video effects (PIP, Green Screen, Faceo-off, etc) are provided. Up to 100 audio and video tracks to use.

With the creation of social video sharing networks online like YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram and Vine, editing and making videos stopped being the exclusive domain of professionals. All you need right now is a good computer system and bingo you are a video editor. You can now edit videos online without downloading any program on your Windows or Mac computer - all you require is a decent network connection to the internet. In this article, we are going to talk about the top 10 most recommended best free online video editing solutions that you can access online.

Most of these free online video editors are beginner-friendly, so even if you just come to the video editing world, you can make a video quickly with these online video editing tools. If you’re an experienced [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), then check our picks of the best professional video editing software.

Personally, I don’t recommend using online tools since sometimes the network connection isn’t good, and when there is a network error, all the efforts are gone. Editing videos with online tools also need high upload and download speed, so it’s suitable for editing short and small size video clips. Besides, online video editing solutions maybe not the best choice if you need more advanced editing options and beautiful video effects. In this case, I highly recommend Wondershare Filmora for the tool you can't miss. Just download it to have a try to explore the editing features, plentiful effects and presets. It can be used on Mac and Windows computers both and is suitable for beginners and semi-pros both.

[![Download Filmora Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Note: in the free trial version of Filmora 11, there will be a watermark like most online video editors listed below.

### #2\. ClipChamp

![online video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Clipchamp is a well-known **free online video editing tool**, besides the video editing tools, it **provides a video compressor, converter, and webcam recorder** as well. The best part is that its **intuitive** work platform allows beginners to complete their video editing within very little time and the output can be directly saved on the computer or shared to Google Drive etc.

Simple drag and drop features allow you to trim, crop, rotate, and flip videos as per their need. Further, it is also possible to adjust brightness, saturation, and contrast with ease. You can also add transitions, text, overlays, backgrounds. There is a stock library that provides both paid and free video and audio files, so you can choose based on your situation.

You can select **different aspect ratios** such as 1:1, 9:16, 4:3, or 16：9, and it also provides **a built-in guide** so you can make a video with it easily. However, you **need to sign up with your Google account or Facebook account** first before using this **all-in-one online video editor**. And the free version is **limited to export at the 480P SD** resolution with **no watermark**. Though you can import 4K footage, it is recommended to compress it first since large files may cause problems when editing, and the **video footage can’t be exported in 4K**. I’m not sure what the problem is, but when I added the audio to the video and play it back, it didn’t go smooth. Let me know if you’ve met the same issue when using it in the comment below.

### #5\. Wideo

![Wideo Online Animated Video Editor Editing Panel ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wideo-online-animated-video-maker.jpg)

Wideo is an online video creating site for **creating animated videos, explainer videos** and other marketing videos with a lot of video templates. **Sign in first** to make a video online with this animated editor and then drag and drop elements of the website's editing service, create a sequence of animations.

Wideo allows you to use the different elements as many times as you want to create your video and unlike some websites, you are not limited to using stock elements (text, cartoons, drawings, and images) and components. It seems that Wideo only allows you to **upload your own images** in .jpg, .png and .gif and backgrounds or music, I didn’t find out a way to add my own video footage to this online video editor. Let me know if you have any clue.

What I like about Wideo is that it allows you to choose **video aspect ratio** such as 16:9, 1:1, and 9;16, and there are **a lot of video templates** available, although most of them need to pay. It also provides a 7 -day trial, and the paid versions cost from 19/mo to 79/mo.

However, if you want to **download** the video on your computer, you’ll **need to upgrade your plan**. If you want to use your own footage and save the edited videos on your desk, Wideo isn't a free option for you.

One amazing thing is that there is no watermark and the video quality is good after cutting clips with Video Toolbox.

You need to **sign up** and activate your account in your email first and then log in to enter the main menu. And to be honest, I found this video editor layout is **outdated and not user-friendly** enough. You need to click the select action to choose the target editing feature and in more cases, there will be **no real-time preview window** to check the editing progress.

You can also add transitions, text, overlays, backgrounds. There is a stock library that provides both paid and free video and audio files, so you can choose based on your situation. However, if you add a logo to your footage, you may need to upgrade to the Paid version.

You can select **different aspect ratios** such as 1:1, 9:16, 4:3, or 16：9, and it also provides **a built-in guide** so you can make a video with it easily. However, you **need to sign up with your Google account or Facebook account** first before using this **all-in-one online video editor**. And the free version is **limited to export at the 480P SD** resolution with **no watermark**. Though you can import 4K footage, it is recommended to compress it first since large files may cause problems when editing, and the **video footage can’t be exported in 4K**. I’m not sure what the problem is, but when I added the audio to the video and play it back, it didn’t go smooth. Let me know if you’ve met the same issue when using it in the comment below.

### #5\. Wideo

Wideo is an online video creating site for **creating animated videos, explainer videos** and other marketing videos with a lot of video templates. **Sign in first** to make a video online with this animated editor and then drag and drop elements of the website's editing service, create a sequence of animations.

Wideo allows you to use the different elements as many times as you want to create your video and unlike some websites, you are not limited to using stock elements (text, cartoons, drawings, and images) and components. It seems that Wideo only allows you to **upload your own images** in .jpg, .png and .gif and backgrounds or music, I didn’t find out a way to add my own video footage to this online video editor. Let me know if you have any clue.

What I like about Wideo is that it allows you to choose **video aspect ratio** such as 16:9, 1:1, and 9;16, and there are **a lot of video templates** available, although most of them need to pay. It also provides a 7 -day trial, and the paid versions cost from 19/mo to 79/mo.

However, if you want to **download** the video on your computer, you’ll **need to upgrade your plan**. If you want to use your own footage and save the edited videos on your desk, Wideo isn't a free option for you.

### #6\. PowToon

The editing features are **simple and limited** but it also allows you to record a webcam. One amazing thing is that there is no watermark and the video quality is good after cutting clips with Video Toolbox.

You need to **sign up** and activate your account in your email first and then log in to enter the main menu. And to be honest, I found this video editor layout is **outdated and not user-friendly** enough. You need to click the select action to choose the target editing feature and in more cases, there will be **no real-time preview window** to check the editing progress.

### #12\. Online Video Cutter

![online video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Though it isn't a video editor to some degree, this intuitive online video editing tool application appears user-friendly and it isn’t limited to cut videos as the name indicates. You can upload videos from computer or via Dropbox, Google Drive or URL directly. With this online video cutter, you can easily **rotate** the videos to 90, 180 or even 270 degrees, **crop** them, **trim** or apply several professional style editing features to create incredible projects.

It can easily handle the **maximum file size of 500MB** and allow users to access any popular media file format with ease. It is free to use and you can access all advanced features even without buying any license.

What I like about this online video editing tool is that **you don’t need to register to use** it and there is also **no watermark** in the saved video. But it would be greater if this online tool can integrate some music and effects as well.

#### 1\. Is There Any Online Video Editor No Watermark?

Yes, there are some free online video editors without watermarks, such as ClipChamp, Online Video Cutter and Hippo Video after exporting. But you should note that in some online video editing tool, the video resolution may be limited to 480p in the free plan.

While, free online video editors like Clip Champ didn't watermark your video but the quality is limited to 480P. Video Toolbox can remain the original quality and keeps no watermark, but the interface isn't intuitive. The rising star Kapwing will be a good choice if you don't need many editing features.

#### 2\. Is There Any Online Video Maker With Music And Pictures?

For those who want to use the music and pictures from the online video maker, I recommend you try Magisto and Kizoa. From the description of these two editors, you can see they are a perfect match.

 **Conclusion**

Above are some free online video makers that you can use right in your browser on both Windows, Mac, Linux or mobile devices if you like. Most of these online video makers are beginners friendly and easy to use since they provide simple editing features. But some of them may need you to register first to use the online video editing tools, and some may leave a braning watermark in the free version.

However, Filmora is one of the easiest-to-use home video editing software with special editing features lets you seamlessly stitch together video clips, music & text, apply effects and get a professional-looking home movie in minutes. All classic video editing functions such as trim, crop, zoom, cut, split as well as stunning video effects (PIP, Green Screen, Faceo-off, etc) are provided. Up to 100 audio and video tracks to use.

"I need to convert some general audio files to AIFF, do you have any recommendations?"

We do, in fact, have some recommendations for you! The AIFF file format, while generally obscure, is accepted by most general audio converters! So, we didn't have any problem finding some that you can use to **AIFF converter**!

#### In this article

01 [What's So Good About AIFF?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Convert M4A to AIFF Free and Easily](#Part 2)

03 [What Makes AIFF Converter the Best Free Online Tool for Mac Users?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **What's So Good About AIFF?**

But okay, what's the deal with AIFF? Is it really all that good? And, if it is, why? For the first part of this article, we've prepared a short overview on the AIFF file format You can skip ahead though if you'd prefer to see the tutorial on **AIFF Converters** or our list of recommendations.

### 01**What's AIFF?**

AIFF, also called the Audio Interchange File Format, is an audio file format that was popularized in 1988\. It was based on the Electronic Arts Interchange File Format and is probably most familiar for Mac users. It's accepted by most media players, including Apple Music and the Apple QuickTime Player.

### 02**Why Is It So Popular?**

Why? Well, it all has to do with the loss of quality. AIFF files are notable because they are uncompressed — leading to an inarguably better sound. That makes it popular with content creators, who want to provide the best possible listening experience to their audience. The caveat to this, of course, is that its uncompressed state means that it takes up a lot more space on one's disk drive. But, many people would be willing to give that up in exchange for the enhanced sound.

## Part 2 **How to Convert M4A to AIFF Free and Easily**

For this next section, we'll be teaching you how to **convert M4A to AIFF** with an online **AIFF converter**.

| Highlights                                                                                                                                        | Highlights                                                                                                                                           |

****2\. ConvertOnMac**

Our next recommended tool is Convert on Mac This is another online tool that can be used to convert a variety of files (i.e., audio, video, image, document, etc). The one that we'll be focusing on though is Convert on Mac's **AIFF Converter**

| Highlights                                                                                                                                                          | Highlights                                                                                                              |

![Convert On Mac Online Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/your-most-essential-guide-towards-picking-best-aiff-converter%2010.png)

****3\. Online Converter**

The next one up is Online Converter This one is more like ZAMZAR than Convert on Mac. If only because it also comes with a max file size that is locked. It's more limited though — in that it doesn't support as many input and output formats. And, as you can no doubt guess from the interface, quite old-school as well.

****4\. [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

****5\. EaseUS Video Converter**

With 'EaseUS Video Converter' we continue on our trend of AIFF conversion software This one, despite its name suggesting otherwise, functions as a solid Audio Converter So far, it's closest to Filmora Pro when compared to all the others on this list. It's a one-trick kind of pony though. Seeing as, unlike with Filmora, you can really only use this to convert files.

This next software, the 'Wondershare UniConverter' is a bit of a mix between Filmora and EaseUS Video Converter.

This is a hidden feature that not many people know about, but iTunes actually works as a pretty serviceable **AIFF Converter**. It's not the most efficient, but with iTunes' AIFF Encoder, conversion to AIFF is possible (converting from AIFF to MP3, and WAV is also possible because iTunes provides Encoders for those as well).

"I need to convert some general audio files to AIFF, do you have any recommendations?"

We do, in fact, have some recommendations for you! The AIFF file format, while generally obscure, is accepted by most general audio converters! So, we didn't have any problem finding some that you can use to **AIFF converter**!

#### In this article

01 [What's So Good About AIFF?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Convert M4A to AIFF Free and Easily](#Part 2)

03 [What Makes AIFF Converter the Best Free Online Tool for Mac Users?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **What's So Good About AIFF?**

But okay, what's the deal with AIFF? Is it really all that good? And, if it is, why? For the first part of this article, we've prepared a short overview on the AIFF file format You can skip ahead though if you'd prefer to see the tutorial on **AIFF Converters** or our list of recommendations.

### 01**What's AIFF?**

AIFF, also called the Audio Interchange File Format, is an audio file format that was popularized in 1988\. It was based on the Electronic Arts Interchange File Format and is probably most familiar for Mac users. It's accepted by most media players, including Apple Music and the Apple QuickTime Player.

### 02**Why Is It So Popular?**

Why? Well, it all has to do with the loss of quality. AIFF files are notable because they are uncompressed — leading to an inarguably better sound. That makes it popular with content creators, who want to provide the best possible listening experience to their audience. The caveat to this, of course, is that its uncompressed state means that it takes up a lot more space on one's disk drive. But, many people would be willing to give that up in exchange for the enhanced sound.

## Part 2 **How to Convert M4A to AIFF Free and Easily**

For this next section, we'll be teaching you how to **convert M4A to AIFF** with an online **AIFF converter**.

"I need to convert some general audio files to AIFF, do you have any recommendations?"

We do, in fact, have some recommendations for you! The AIFF file format, while generally obscure, is accepted by most general audio converters! So, we didn't have any problem finding some that you can use to **AIFF converter**!

#### In this article

01 [What's So Good About AIFF?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Convert M4A to AIFF Free and Easily](#Part 2)

03 [What Makes AIFF Converter the Best Free Online Tool for Mac Users?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **What's So Good About AIFF?**

But okay, what's the deal with AIFF? Is it really all that good? And, if it is, why? For the first part of this article, we've prepared a short overview on the AIFF file format You can skip ahead though if you'd prefer to see the tutorial on **AIFF Converters** or our list of recommendations.

### 01**What's AIFF?**

AIFF, also called the Audio Interchange File Format, is an audio file format that was popularized in 1988\. It was based on the Electronic Arts Interchange File Format and is probably most familiar for Mac users. It's accepted by most media players, including Apple Music and the Apple QuickTime Player.

### 02**Why Is It So Popular?**

Why? Well, it all has to do with the loss of quality. AIFF files are notable because they are uncompressed — leading to an inarguably better sound. That makes it popular with content creators, who want to provide the best possible listening experience to their audience. The caveat to this, of course, is that its uncompressed state means that it takes up a lot more space on one's disk drive. But, many people would be willing to give that up in exchange for the enhanced sound.

## Part 2 **How to Convert M4A to AIFF Free and Easily**

For this next section, we'll be teaching you how to **convert M4A to AIFF** with an online **AIFF converter**.

****2\. ConvertOnMac**

Our next recommended tool is Convert on Mac This is another online tool that can be used to convert a variety of files (i.e., audio, video, image, document, etc). The one that we'll be focusing on though is Convert on Mac's **AIFF Converter**

****3\. Online Converter**

The next one up is Online Converter This one is more like ZAMZAR than Convert on Mac. If only because it also comes with a max file size that is locked. It's more limited though — in that it doesn't support as many input and output formats. And, as you can no doubt guess from the interface, quite old-school as well.

With 'EaseUS Video Converter' we continue on our trend of AIFF conversion software This one, despite its name suggesting otherwise, functions as a solid Audio Converter So far, it's closest to Filmora Pro when compared to all the others on this list.

"I need to convert some general audio files to AIFF, do you have any recommendations?"

We do, in fact, have some recommendations for you! The AIFF file format, while generally obscure, is accepted by most general audio converters! So, we didn't have any problem finding some that you can use to **AIFF converter**!

01 [What's So Good About AIFF?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Convert M4A to AIFF Free and Easily](#Part 2)

03 [What Makes AIFF Converter the Best Free Online Tool for Mac Users?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **What's So Good About AIFF?**

But okay, what's the deal with AIFF? Is it really all that good? And, if it is, why? For the first part of this article, we've prepared a short overview on the AIFF file format You can skip ahead though if you'd prefer to see the tutorial on **AIFF Converters** or our list of recommendations.

### 01**What's AIFF?**

AIFF, also called the Audio Interchange File Format, is an audio file format that was popularized in 1988\. It was based on the Electronic Arts Interchange File Format and is probably most familiar for Mac users. It's accepted by most media players, including Apple Music and the Apple QuickTime Player.

### 02**Why Is It So Popular?**

Why? Well, it all has to do with the loss of quality. AIFF files are notable because they are uncompressed — leading to an inarguably better sound. That makes it popular with content creators, who want to provide the best possible listening experience to their audience. The caveat to this, of course, is that its uncompressed state means that it takes up a lot more space on one's disk drive. But, many people would be willing to give that up in exchange for the enhanced sound.

## Part 2 **How to Convert M4A to AIFF Free and Easily**

For this next section, we'll be teaching you how to **convert M4A to AIFF** with an online **AIFF converter**. The benefit of using an online converter like the one we'll be showing you how to use is that it is usually FREE and very efficient.

****2\. ConvertOnMac**

Our next recommended tool is Convert on Mac This is another online tool that can be used to convert a variety of files (i.e., audio, video, image, document, etc). The one that we'll be focusing on though is Convert on Mac's **AIFF Converter**

| Highlights                                                                                                                                                          | Highlights                                                                                                              |

****3\. Online Converter**

The next one up is Online Converter This one is more like ZAMZAR than Convert on Mac. If only because it also comes with a max file size that is locked. It's more limited though — in that it doesn't support as many input and output formats. And, as you can no doubt guess from the interface, quite old-school as well.

| Highlights                                                                                               | Highlights                                                                                      |

****4\. [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

For this next **AIFF Converter**, we make a complete departure from your general converters by introducing a completely different beast altogether Specifically, in the form of a Video Editor called Filmora. Filmora is an incredibly advanced video editing tool. And, because of this, it's capable of most things related to video and audio editing. Including, in this case, AIFF conversion

| Highlights                                                                                                                                                     | Highlights                                                                                                                                  |

****5\. EaseUS Video Converter**

With 'EaseUS Video Converter' we continue on our trend of AIFF conversion software This one, despite its name suggesting otherwise, functions as a solid Audio Converter So far, it's closest to Filmora Pro when compared to all the others on this list. It's a one-trick kind of pony though. Seeing as, unlike with Filmora, you can really only use this to convert files.

| Highlights                                                                                                   | Highlights                                                                                    |

****6\. Wondershare UniConverter**

This next software, the 'Wondershare UniConverter' is a bit of a mix between Filmora and EaseUS Video Converter. As is evident from the UI (shown-off in the screenshot provided), it has the makings of a straightforward converter but with extra tools (i.e., video editor, video compressor, merger, screen recorder, etc.) that you can take advantage of while working on your conversions.

| Highlights                                                                                                    | Highlights                                                                                                                         |

****7\. VSDC Free Audio Converter**

Next up, we have VSDC VSDC is a FREE Audio Converter. It's pretty old-school (as is perhaps evident from the UI example) but it supports a variety of audio formats, including AIFF, which earned it a spot on this list of ours

| Highlights                                                                                                            | Highlights                                                                                      |

****8\. Switch Audio File Converter**

Switch Audio File Converter is a Mac AIFF Converter. You can find it on the Mac APP Store, or purchase it directly on the NCH Software website. For the FREE app version, you have access to certain functions, with the rest being locked under in-app purchases.

****9\. iTunes - Apple**

This is a hidden feature that not many people know about, but iTunes actually works as a pretty serviceable **AIFF Converter**. It's not the most efficient, but with iTunes' AIFF Encoder, conversion to AIFF is possible (converting from AIFF to MP3, and WAV is also possible because iTunes provides Encoders for those as well).

| Highlights                                                                                                              | Highlights                                                                                                                     |
