 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

While most videos nowadays are rectangular, and are recorded in either landscape or portrait orientation, there are some social media platforms that require the clips to be square shaped. If you want to upload your footages on such websites, it is essential to learn **how to change video shape**.

Another benefit of changing the shape of the recorded films is that they can be adjusted in limited amount of space, especially if they are to be posted on a website. Furthermore, some fancy designs such as star-shaped or circle-shaped videos attract more attention when used in digital marketing campaigns.

With that said, here you will learn **how to change the shape of a video** using one of the most advanced and versatile post-production tools, Wondershare Filmora.

Want to learn more about aspect ratio of your video? [Click here!](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Or, you just want to [transfer your video into vertical.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## Part 1: How to Change Video Shape from Rectangle to Square

Depending on the recording device and the target audiences a video is intended to be distributed to, the aspect ratio of the produced footage could be 16:9, 4:3, or 21:9 that makes the film rectangular-shaped. Given that, the aspect ratio can be modified to change the film shape from rectangle to square.

The instructions given below explain **how to change video shape** from rectangle to square in Wondershare Filmora:

**Step 1: Import Video to Timeline**

Launch Wondershare Filmora on your PC (a Windows 10 computer is used here), click the **Add Files** icon from the center of the **Media** window present at the upper-left section, and use the **Open** box that appears to select and import the source video to Filmora. Next, drag the video from the **Media** window to the Timeline, and select your preferred option when/if the **Project Setting** confirmation box appears.

**Step 2: Change Aspect Ratio**

Select the video in the Timeline, and click the **Crop and Zoom** icon from the upper-left area of the Timeline itself. On the **Crop and Zoom** window that opens next, select **1:1** from the **Ratio** drop-down list, and click **OK** to save the new setting.

**Step 3: Export the Video**

Click **EXPORT** from the top-center area of the interface, go to the **Local** tab on the **Export** box, select your preferred format from the **Format** list in the left pane, optionally click **SETTINGS** from the right window to make other adjustments if necessary, and click **EXPORT** from the bottom-right corner of the box.

For more details, please refer to this article: [How to Resize a Video to Right Aspect Ratio and Size.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## Part 2: Change Video Shape by Cropping

If your preferred aspect ratio isn’t available in the ‘Ratio’ drop-down list of the ‘Crop and Zoom’ window, Wondershare Filmora allows you to manually change the video to a custom shape.

![crop-video-9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/crop-video-9.jpg)

You can learn **how to change the shape of a video** to an unlisted aspect ratio by following the instructions given below:

**Step 1: Import the Video and Get to the Crop and Zoom Window**

Follow the method explained in **Step 1** of **Part 1** to import a video to Wondershare Filmora, and then add it to the Timeline.

**Step 2: Select Custom Ratio**

Select the video in the Timeline, and click the **Crop and Zoom** icon as explained earlier to open its window. Next, select **Custom** from the **Ratio** drop-down list to be able to crop the videos unproportionally.

**Step 3: Crop the Video Manually**

Drag the cropping handles from any one edge of the video. Repeat this process for all the four sides to select the area of interest. Click **OK** to save the changes.

**Step 4: Export the Video**

Follow the process explained in **Step 3** of **Part 1** to export the modified video.

## Part 3: Change Video Shape to Circle or Other Shapes in Filmora

Another, rather better way of changing videos to custom shapes is with the help of image or shape masking.

In Filmora you can apply image masks either from the existing presets, i.e. circle, star, diamond, etc., or you can add custom photos if need be. Professionals generally use custom pictures to create fancy logos and titles.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

On the other hand, shape masking allows you to mask a background video with a foreground footage in a custom shape.

Although the basic concept of both types of masking is same, the options available under each can be used to produce effective outputs.

That said, following are the instructions to apply both types of masking to your videos:

#### Image Masking

The steps given below explain **how to change video shape** with image masking in Filmora:

**Step 1: Add Clip to Timeline**

Use the method explained in the previous sections to import a clip and add it to the Timeline.

**Step 2: Add Image Mask**

Click **Effects** from the standard toolbar at the top, select **Utility** from the left pane, drag **Image Mask** from the **Utility** window, and drop it on top of the video itself in the Timeline. Notice how the **_fx_** icon appears on the video layer showing that the effect has been successfully added.

**Step 3: Customize Image Mask**

On the Timeline, double-click the video layer you applied **Image Mask** to, and notice all the available shapes available under the **Preset Mask** section on the **Video Effects** \> **Image Mask** window that appears at the upper-left area. You can double-click any of the available shape presets to apply it to the video layer. In addition, drag the **X** and **Y**, and **Width**, **Height**, and **Feather** sliders to adjust the mask’s position, size, and edge smoothness respectively. You can also check the **Invert Mask** box to reverse the masking effect on the video. Finally, click **OK** to save the changes, and follow the method explained in earlier parts to export the video.

#### Shape Masking

The following steps explain **how to change the shape of a video** with shape masks in Filmora:

**Step 1: Get to the Utility Window**

Add at two footages on their individual layers in the Timeline (make sure to place the second layer above the first one), and follow the method explained above to get to the **Effects** \> **Utility** window.

**Step 2: Add Shape Mask**

Drag **Shape Mask** from the **Utility** window, and drop it on top of the video itself in the Timeline. Confirm that the **_fx_** icon appears on the video layer to ensure that the effect has been applied.

**Step 3: Customize Shape Mask**

Double-click the video layer in the Timeline you applied shape mask to. On the **Video Effects** \> **Shape Mask** window, use the **X** and **Y**, and **Width**, **Height**, and **Feather** sliders to adjust the mask’s position, size and edge smoothness respectively. Optionally check the **Invert Mask** box to reverse the masking effect, and click **OK** to save the settings. Next, follow the method explained earlier to export the video.

**FAQs**

**1\. What’s the difference between Image Mask and Shape Mask in Filmora?**

A) In Filmora, Image Mask allows you to use an image (or any available preset) for masking so that the background footage is cropped to the shape of the picture. This is generally used to create logos and dynamic titles for movies or documentaries. On the other hand, Shape Mask enables you to mask the background clip with the foreground footage in the form of a shape that could be positioned and customized using the available sliders.

**2\. How many image masks are available in Filmora?**

A) At the time of this writing, Wondershare Filmora has around 40 image mask presets. In addition, it also allows you to add custom images from your PC for more dynamic approach.

 Finding an image you like on the Internet doesn’t take long, since almost every website you can stumble upon, contains at least one picture. This doesn’t mean that you can just download any photo and use it in your blog, online marketing campaign or for any other purpose. Moreover, stock image websites like Getty Images or iStock let you purchase the right to use a photo commercially. As a reaction to an expanding stock image industry, many photographers, museums and cultural institutions are choosing to forfeit their rights and to publish public domain images. So, in this article, we are going to take you through the ten best public domain image websites where you can download pictures for free.

## What Are Public Domain Images?

 By definition, public domain images are photos, vectors or clip art that are available to anyone because their copyright has either expired or they never had a copyright owner. Consequently, anyone can use these images for both commercial or private projects without having to purchase the rights to do so. An image can enter a public domain under the following circumstances:

* Scientists, educators or artists can use the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license to dedicate their images to the public domain
* A picture’s copyright is no longer in effect
* A photo was never the subject to copyright

 It is of utmost importance to check if an image is within the public domain before you use it publicly in order to avoid potential legal complications.

## How and Where to Find Public Domain Images?

 A simple google search will reveal hundreds of websites that let you download public domain and royalty-free images. Which source you’re going to use depends on the type of image you’re looking for, since some websites are dedicated only to photography, while others feature impressive collections of public domain images of artworks. In addition, you’ll only want to download public domain images from the websites that offer information about the author because using a public domain image without crediting its author is strictly prohibited.

## Best Websites for Downloading Public Domain Images

That’s why you must click on the Free Photos tab before you start searching for public domain images on this website. The website hosts nearly 400.000 photos, videos, and vector graphics, but you must make sure that a file you want to download is within the public domain before you download it.

**Pros:**

* Creating an account on Morguefile is free

## How to Cite Public Domain Images Properly?

 If you’re planning on using a public domain image in a blog or on your website, you must cite the source from which you acquired a particular image. The image citations should include the following information:

* The title of the image
* Author’s name
* Information about the institution at which an image is kept
* The source from which you acquired an image

 In case you don’t have access to all of these information or if the information is simply not available you should include all details about a public domain image you have the access to. Furthermore, there are several styles of image citations that depend on the source from which an image was acquired.

 Finding an image you like on the Internet doesn’t take long, since almost every website you can stumble upon, contains at least one picture. This doesn’t mean that you can just download any photo and use it in your blog, online marketing campaign or for any other purpose. Moreover, stock image websites like Getty Images or iStock let you purchase the right to use a photo commercially. As a reaction to an expanding stock image industry, many photographers, museums and cultural institutions are choosing to forfeit their rights and to publish public domain images. So, in this article, we are going to take you through the ten best public domain image websites where you can download pictures for free.

 By definition, public domain images are photos, vectors or clip art that are available to anyone because their copyright has either expired or they never had a copyright owner. Consequently, anyone can use these images for both commercial or private projects without having to purchase the rights to do so. An image can enter a public domain under the following circumstances:

* Scientists, educators or artists can use the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license to dedicate their images to the public domain
* A picture’s copyright is no longer in effect
* A photo was never the subject to copyright

 It is of utmost importance to check if an image is within the public domain before you use it publicly in order to avoid potential legal complications.

## How and Where to Find Public Domain Images?

 A simple google search will reveal hundreds of websites that let you download public domain and royalty-free images. Which source you’re going to use depends on the type of image you’re looking for, since some websites are dedicated only to photography, while others feature impressive collections of public domain images of artworks. In addition, you’ll only want to download public domain images from the websites that offer information about the author because using a public domain image without crediting its author is strictly prohibited.

* Limited amount of available public domain images

#### 6. [From Old Books](https://www.fromoldbooks.org/)

 In case you are searching for images from old books you should look no further. This is a private collection of 2,600 images that are hard to find anywhere else on the Internet. You can browse through woodcuts, old texts or old holiday images, which makes this platform an excellent choice for anyone interested in rare images that were featured in old books. All pictures you can find on the From Old Books website are free to use on non-commercial projects, but you must pay a small fee if you want to download a high-resolution image you can use on a commercial project.

* Images are organized into categories
* Access to rare images

**Cons**

* Some images are not free
* Rudimentary website design

#### 7. [Morguefile](https://morguefile.com/)

![Morguefile public domain image  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/morguefile-public-domain-search.jpg)

 Morguefile is a website that offers stock footage to its users, but some of the images can’t be downloaded for free. That’s why you must click on the Free Photos tab before you start searching for public domain images on this website. The website hosts nearly 400.000 photos, videos, and vector graphics, but you must make sure that a file you want to download is within the public domain before you download it. The only downside is that the images aren’t organized into categories which can make finding the images you’re searching for more difficult than it needs to be.

**Pros:**

* Creating an account on Morguefile is free
* All free photos can be used on commercial projects

**Cons:**

* Images can be organized better
* Fewer free images than on other public domain image websites

#### 8. [Public Domain Archive](https://www.publicdomainarchive.com/)

 As the website’s name indicates, this is an archive of public domain images you can download for free and use in commercial contexts. All photos are organized into categories like abstract, free stock photos, people or wood which makes the search simpler. However, these categories don’t contain more than a few hundred photos and some of them offer as few as five pictures you can download. All photos are in high resolution and ready for professional use. The download process can be completed effortlessly in just a few quick steps. New images are added on a weekly basis.

**Pros:**

* Professional quality of images
* All images are free

**Cons:**

* A limited selection of photos
* Doesn’t offer vector graphics

#### 9. [NYPL Digital Gallery](https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/)

![NYPL Digital Gallery  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/digitalcollections.jpg)

 NYPL Digital Gallery is an excellent resource for anyone who is not interested in stock photography. The New Your Public Library has made hundreds of thousands of historical images available to the public and you can use it to browse through items, collections or divisions. Before you enter a keyword you should click on the search only public domain materials tick box to ensure that the search results are going to display only images that can be used without restrictions. Additionally, the NYPL Digital Gallery lets you browse through its collection of digital books while its collections of photographs include the work of some of the highly esteemed American photographers.

**Pros**

* Public domain images are available in different resolutions
* Offers valuable research materials

**Cons**

* Some images are subject to copyright
* Only aimed at scholars and researchers

#### 10. [Viintage](https://www.viintage.com/)

 Viintage is a gold mine for graphic designers as it grants them access to hundreds of vintage posters, book covers, and images. However, the amount of public domain images this website offers is limited and if you want to download the images from the collections of works created by famous artists from the late 19th and early 20th centuries you must purchase the premium version of Viintage. The website lacks some basic search options as it only allows you to type in the search term into the search bar. The images are not organized into categories which further complicates the process of finding a public domain image you’re looking for.

**Pros:**

* Offers a collection of rare vintage public domain images
* A great resource for graphic designers

**Cons:**

* Most images on Viintage can’t be downloaded for free
* Search tools are far from perfect

## How to Cite Public Domain Images Properly?

 If you’re planning on using a public domain image in a blog or on your website, you must cite the source from which you acquired a particular image. The image citations should include the following information:

* The title of the image
* Author’s name
* Information about the institution at which an image is kept
* The source from which you acquired an image

 In case you don’t have access to all of these information or if the information is simply not available you should include all details about a public domain image you have the access to. Furthermore, there are several styles of image citations that depend on the source from which an image was acquired.

**Conclusion**

 Spending large sums of money on images you can use in commercial or private projects is not always necessary. The public domain images are widely available and they can be used in a broad range of contexts. Which website that lets you download public domain images do you like to use the most? Leave a comment and share your opinions with us.

# Top 15 Adobe Premiere Plugins for Effects and Transitions

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg)

##### Benjamin Arango

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Although Premiere is a complete and robust platform, there is always room for customization, extras, and just plain cool add-ons that are too niche for Adobe to produce themselves.

For example, you can add [free Adobe Premiere title templates](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to make your video excellent.

While everyone's list will be different depending on what they use Premiere for, here is my choice of tools and effects that I find the most useful.

* [**Part 1: Top 15 Adobe Premiere Pro Plugins for Transitions and Effects**](#part1)
* [**Part 2: FAQ about Adobe Premiere Plugins**](#part2)

## Best Alternative to Adobe Premiere - Filmora

The Premiere is excellent if you can find the best Adobe Premiere plugin at the time and money price.

If you want to edit videos easily, here we recommend using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). It is designed for pros who want to make video easily or want to enter a professional video editing level.

For transitions, it has various built-in creative tools to use, including dissolve, motion, zoom, and more. For effects, you can use cinematic effects without efforts.

Unlimited tracks can power up your story with various videos and audio. Free download it to have a try!

Before choosing a plugin, you should consider [compatibility](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/compatibility.html) and [extensibility](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/extensibility.html) in case the plugin is not working with Premiere. You can also visit the Adobe [partner finder database](https://www.adobe.com/partners.html) to have a closer relationship with developers around the world if you want to search for plugin partners

## Part 1: Top 15 Adobe Premiere Pro Plugins for Transitions and Effects

#### 1[After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html)

Some may say this is cheating, but for me, this is the number one add-on for Premiere. There is a reason for this, and that is that After Effects enables you to create anything you can dream of wanting within the Premiere environment.

Graphics, transitions, titles and templates, composites and a myriad of other options can be created and imported directly into Premiere. They integrate perfectly and enable smooth transitions between a Premiere project, creating an effect or graphic in After Effects.

Other plugins appear in this list that are extremely capable of a specific scenario, but none of the breadth of ability that After Effects brings to the table.

It is the best Adobe Premiere plugins to download.

**Price**: $20.99/month

**Features**

* **Steep learning**: we have to admit that it is not easy to make Adobe Premiere plugins with Effects, but if you have learned how-to, you are the master.
* **Animation**: If you like animation style video, you can use it to make Adobe Premiere animation plugins.

![After Effects adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-1.png)

#### 2[Neat Video](https://www.neatvideo.com/index.html?linkID=p7334)

Neat Video is a great plugin for Premiere, unlike After Effects it has a single function, and that is noise reduction. It is very good at it.

While Camera technology has advanced at a remarkable rate, there are still circumstances when even the best cameras available to us produce a video that is a little too noisy for its intended use, and this is where Neat Video steps in.

It works as a video filter from within the Premiere environment. It can be applied to a sequence in its entirety of any number of individual clips within the sequence as desired.

Although aimed at noise reduction for modern digital cameras, Neat Video is also very useful in the digitization process of older VHS or film stock. It can be used to clean up the resulting digital file.

**Price**: $74.9/month

**Features**

* **Underwater shots**: You can make underwater shots with this plug-in. With it, you can make your video more beautiful.
* **Accurate and efficient**: As the best Adobe Premiere plugin, it can offer you an accurate effect.

![free download Neat Video adobe plugins](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-2.png)

#### 3[Final Effects](http://www.borisfx.com/Adobe/fecae/)

A utility box of effects and transitions if ever there was one, Final Effects integrates smoothly with Premiere and includes over 120 different items. If you want to broaden your effects library but do not have any specific requirements, then this is the product for you. I particularly like the 3D relief effect, but there is something in here for every type of project you can think.

**Price**: $2495 for all bundles

**Features**

* **Stylized looks**: it offers various filters to use
* **Auto-animating transitions**: you can make animation style transitions auto.

![Final Effects adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-3.png)

#### 4[Magic Bullet Looks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TG2IG36/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00TG2IG36&linkId=40a4862dea2acf5507b237e385f8d55e)

This is a wondrous plugin that is primarily a color finishing tool but includes a raft of options that make it much more useful. The color finishing is first class. It comes with over 100 included presets organized by category so you can quickly find the right one for your project, plus the ability to fine-tune and save the results as custom presets meaning the possibilities are endless to obtain the right unified look you wish for your project.

In addition, options for lens distortion and lighting enable either corrections or stylized looks to be implemented to complement the color choices made.

**Price**: $899

**Features**

* **Great compatibility**: it works well on Windows and Mac.
* **Price**: the price may be higher than we thought.

![download Magic Bullet Looks adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-4.png)

#### 5[Flicker Free](http://digitalanarchy.com/Flicker/main.html)

This one is quite a specific plugin that won't be for everyone, but if you are a regular proponent of time-lapse or slow-motion footage, this is a plugin that will be your best friend for life. One of the time-lapse issues is the changing exposures during such filming that produce a flickering effect when viewed.

What flicker-free does is to normalize the exposure and remove the flicker. It not only works on time-lapse, but can solve similar issues with slow-motion filming, and even assist with the rolling effect you can get from LED lighting and computer monitors.

It works from within Premiere and comes with useful presets to make the process as simple as possible. However, they can all be individually tweaked where necessary to get the perfect results.

**Price**: $79/$99.

**Features**

* **Fluent workflow**: the working experience is great if you try it.
* Time-lapse: You can make the time-lapse or slow-motion video better by specific Premiere plugin.

![free download Flicker adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-5.png)

#### 6[Damage](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N1JPCEW/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01N1JPCEW&linkId=01542ff77ba269b302237cf03a190f81)

Another great plugin that is very specific in its use, Damage is, despite the name, a non-destructive filter plugin that simulates the grain, glitches, scan lines, and grit of aged film stock. There are over 80 presets available to use, and whilst its use is not going to be hugely widespread, for producing that aged effect there is nothing better.

**Price**: $299

**Features**

* 5 tool kits: it includes 5 Adobe Premiere plug-ins

![Damage adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-6.png)

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win-pro.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac-pro.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 7[Rays](http://www.digitalfilmtools.com/rays/)

This is a nice plugin that allows the creation of, you've guessed it, Rays. That is light rays to be precise. Atmospheric, beautiful, they can be many things, but there is no questioning the effectiveness of this plugin at simulating light rays. It's outstanding, as this promotional image shows.

**Price**: $95

**Features**

* Rays only: if you love rays, this one won't let you regret it.
* Natural lights: this Premiere offers natural lights

![Rays free download adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-7.png)

#### 8 [Coremelt](http://www.coremelt.com/products/coremelt-complete-v2.html)

Another 'box of tricks' style product, Coremelt includes a huge number over 220 of effects and transitions.

It's the sheer breadth of options within the package that makes this one a must for any aspiring video editor.

**Price**: $199

**Features**

* Well-designed: you can make great Adobe Premiere plugins as it is well designed. It is easy and quick to use.
* Various plugs: it offers over Premiere 220 plugins to download.

![Coremelt adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-8.png)

#### 9[VitaScene](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0147OKANG/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0147OKANG&linkId=61e1b9e2197cf8e36e012a4ea8f7c122)

This is a professional grade package of effects and transitions that raises the bar for what is possible. My favorite one is the tilt-shift that produces that toy-like landscape that has become popular within the photography world in recent years.

There are over 600 effects within the Vitascene package. It is not the cheapest out there by any means, but is aimed squarely at the professional output and has the quality to do it.

**Price**: $599

**Features**

#### 11[FilmConvert](https://www.filmconvert.com/)

If you want to give your video clip a cinematic look quickly, here is another Adobe Premiere plugin you should know. FilmConvert can help you adjust your video color, so you won't spend much time making a color correction. You can also add film grain to your video within a few clicks.

Although Premiere is a complete and robust platform, there is always room for customization, extras, and just plain cool add-ons that are too niche for Adobe to produce themselves.

For example, you can add [free Adobe Premiere title templates](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to make your video excellent.

While everyone's list will be different depending on what they use Premiere for, here is my choice of tools and effects that I find the most useful.

## Part 1: Top 15 Adobe Premiere Pro Plugins for Transitions and Effects

#### 1[After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html)

Some may say this is cheating, but for me, this is the number one add-on for Premiere. There is a reason for this, and that is that After Effects enables you to create anything you can dream of wanting within the Premiere environment.

Graphics, transitions, titles and templates, composites and a myriad of other options can be created and imported directly into Premiere. They integrate perfectly and enable smooth transitions between a Premiere project, creating an effect or graphic in After Effects.

Other plugins appear in this list that are extremely capable of a specific scenario, but none of the breadth of ability that After Effects brings to the table.

It is the best Adobe Premiere plugins to download.

**Price**: $20.99/month

**Features**

* **Steep learning**: we have to admit that it is not easy to make Adobe Premiere plugins with Effects, but if you have learned how-to, you are the master.
* **Animation**: If you like animation style video, you can use it to make Adobe Premiere animation plugins.

![After Effects adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-1.png)

#### 2[Neat Video](https://www.neatvideo.com/index.html?linkID=p7334)

Neat Video is a great plugin for Premiere, unlike After Effects it has a single function, and that is noise reduction. It is very good at it.

While Camera technology has advanced at a remarkable rate, there are still circumstances when even the best cameras available to us produce a video that is a little too noisy for its intended use, and this is where Neat Video steps in.

It works as a video filter from within the Premiere environment. It can be applied to a sequence in its entirety of any number of individual clips within the sequence as desired.

Although aimed at noise reduction for modern digital cameras, Neat Video is also very useful in the digitization process of older VHS or film stock. It can be used to clean up the resulting digital file.

**Price**: $74.9/month

**Features**

* **Underwater shots**: You can make underwater shots with this plug-in. With it, you can make your video more beautiful.
* **Accurate and efficient**: As the best Adobe Premiere plugin, it can offer you an accurate effect.

![free download Neat Video adobe plugins](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-2.png)

#### 3[Final Effects](http://www.borisfx.com/Adobe/fecae/)

A utility box of effects and transitions if ever there was one, Final Effects integrates smoothly with Premiere and includes over 120 different items. If you want to broaden your effects library but do not have any specific requirements, then this is the product for you. I particularly like the 3D relief effect, but there is something in here for every type of project you can think.

**Price**: $2495 for all bundles

**Features**

* **Stylized looks**: it offers various filters to use
* **Auto-animating transitions**: you can make animation style transitions auto.

This is a wondrous plugin that is primarily a color finishing tool but includes a raft of options that make it much more useful. The color finishing is first class. It comes with over 100 included presets organized by category so you can quickly find the right one for your project, plus the ability to fine-tune and save the results as custom presets meaning the possibilities are endless to obtain the right unified look you wish for your project.

In addition, options for lens distortion and lighting enable either corrections or stylized looks to be implemented to complement the color choices made.

**Price**: $899

**Features**

* **Great compatibility**: it works well on Windows and Mac.
* **Price**: the price may be higher than we thought.

#### 5[Flicker Free](http://digitalanarchy.com/Flicker/main.html)

This one is quite a specific plugin that won't be for everyone, but if you are a regular proponent of time-lapse or slow-motion footage, this is a plugin that will be your best friend for life. One of the time-lapse issues is the changing exposures during such filming that produce a flickering effect when viewed.

What flicker-free does is to normalize the exposure and remove the flicker. It not only works on time-lapse, but can solve similar issues with slow-motion filming, and even assist with the rolling effect you can get from LED lighting and computer monitors.

It works from within Premiere and comes with useful presets to make the process as simple as possible. However, they can all be individually tweaked where necessary to get the perfect results.

**Price**: $79/$99.

**Features**

* **Fluent workflow**: the working experience is great if you try it.

Neat Video is a great plugin for Premiere, unlike After Effects it has a single function, and that is noise reduction. It is very good at it.

While Camera technology has advanced at a remarkable rate, there are still circumstances when even the best cameras available to us produce a video that is a little too noisy for its intended use, and this is where Neat Video steps in.

It works as a video filter from within the Premiere environment. It can be applied to a sequence in its entirety of any number of individual clips within the sequence as desired.

Although aimed at noise reduction for modern digital cameras, Neat Video is also very useful in the digitization process of older VHS or film stock. It can be used to clean up the resulting digital file.

**Price**: $74.9/month

**Features**

* **Underwater shots**: You can make underwater shots with this plug-in. With it, you can make your video more beautiful.
* **Accurate and efficient**: As the best Adobe Premiere plugin, it can offer you an accurate effect.

![free download Neat Video adobe plugins](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-2.png)

#### 3[Final Effects](http://www.borisfx.com/Adobe/fecae/)

A utility box of effects and transitions if ever there was one, Final Effects integrates smoothly with Premiere and includes over 120 different items. If you want to broaden your effects library but do not have any specific requirements, then this is the product for you. I particularly like the 3D relief effect, but there is something in here for every type of project you can think.

**Price**: $2495 for all bundles

**Features**

* **Stylized looks**: it offers various filters to use
* **Auto-animating transitions**: you can make animation style transitions auto.

#### 4[Magic Bullet Looks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TG2IG36/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00TG2IG36&linkId=40a4862dea2acf5507b237e385f8d55e)

This is a wondrous plugin that is primarily a color finishing tool but includes a raft of options that make it much more useful. The color finishing is first class. It comes with over 100 included presets organized by category so you can quickly find the right one for your project, plus the ability to fine-tune and save the results as custom presets meaning the possibilities are endless to obtain the right unified look you wish for your project.

In addition, options for lens distortion and lighting enable either corrections or stylized looks to be implemented to complement the color choices made.

**Price**: $899

**Features**

* **Great compatibility**: it works well on Windows and Mac.
* **Price**: the price may be higher than we thought.

![download Magic Bullet Looks adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-4.png)

#### 5[Flicker Free](http://digitalanarchy.com/Flicker/main.html)

This one is quite a specific plugin that won't be for everyone, but if you are a regular proponent of time-lapse or slow-motion footage, this is a plugin that will be your best friend for life. One of the time-lapse issues is the changing exposures during such filming that produce a flickering effect when viewed.

What flicker-free does is to normalize the exposure and remove the flicker. It not only works on time-lapse, but can solve similar issues with slow-motion filming, and even assist with the rolling effect you can get from LED lighting and computer monitors.

It works from within Premiere and comes with useful presets to make the process as simple as possible. However, they can all be individually tweaked where necessary to get the perfect results.

**Price**: $79/$99.

**Features**

* **Fluent workflow**: the working experience is great if you try it.
* Time-lapse: You can make the time-lapse or slow-motion video better by specific Premiere plugin.

![free download Flicker adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-5.png)

#### 6[Damage](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N1JPCEW/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01N1JPCEW&linkId=01542ff77ba269b302237cf03a190f81)

Another great plugin that is very specific in its use, Damage is, despite the name, a non-destructive filter plugin that simulates the grain, glitches, scan lines, and grit of aged film stock. There are over 80 presets available to use, and whilst its use is not going to be hugely widespread, for producing that aged effect there is nothing better.

**Price**: $299

**Features**

* 5 tool kits: it includes 5 Adobe Premiere plug-ins
