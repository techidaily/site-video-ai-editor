However, in order to start using the free or paid version of this image to video maker, you first have to create an account and make sure that you are signed in. In addition, if you opt for the free version of Picovico, all videos you create are going to be watermarked, and their quality and duration are going to be limited.

#### 5. [Pholody](https://www.pholody.com/editor)

**Price:** Free

Additionally, you also use Movie Maker Online to search for free music you can use in your videos without having to worry about the copyrights. The platform’s interface, however, is far from perfect and it may take you some time to get used to it and figure out how to add text to the photos you’re using in your video or how to choose for how long a photo is going to be displayed on the screen.

#### 9. [Slideshow Photos](https://slideshow.photos/)

**Price:** Free

![ Image to Video online maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slide-show-online-image-to-video-online.jpg)

If you choose one of the subscription plans, you will be able to enhance each photo you include in your slideshow, before you export it to social media.

#### 11. [Adobe Spark](https://spark.adobe.com/make/slideshow-maker/)

**Price:** Free, Available through Adobe Creative Cloud Plan for $52.99 per month or as a stand-alone app for $9.99 per month

## Editing on Steroids: Top 40 Final Cut Pro X Keyboard Shortcuts

# Top 40 Keyboard Shortcuts for Final Cut Pro X

I confess I'm a keyboard shortcut junkie. Anything I can do to help me edit faster is a good thing, and nothing says "speed" like keyboard shortcuts. There are well over 600 menu options in FCP X, with hundreds of keyboard shortcuts. But, which ones are the best?

In this article, I share my Top 40 keyboard shortcuts. I use these beauties every day to help me get my projects done faster. Now, you can use them, too. Even better, I've categorized them to make them easier to find. Haven't got FCPX yet? [Get your 90-day free trial here.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

(And, for those who take the time to count, you'll discover this list actually includes 53 keyboard shortcuts. But using "Top 40" in the title seemed so much sexier than "Top 53.")

I confess I'm a keyboard shortcut junkie. Anything I can do to help me edit faster is a good thing, and nothing says "speed" like keyboard shortcuts. There are well over 600 menu options in FCP X, with hundreds of keyboard shortcuts. But, which ones are the best?

In this article, I share my Top 40 keyboard shortcuts. I use these beauties every day to help me get my projects done faster. Now, you can use them, too. Even better, I've categorized them to make them easier to find. Haven't got FCPX yet? [Get your 90-day free trial here.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

(And, for those who take the time to count, you'll discover this list actually includes 53 keyboard shortcuts. But using "Top 40" in the title seemed so much sexier than "Top 53.")

I confess I'm a keyboard shortcut junkie. Anything I can do to help me edit faster is a good thing, and nothing says "speed" like keyboard shortcuts. There are well over 600 menu options in FCP X, with hundreds of keyboard shortcuts. But, which ones are the best?

In this article, I share my Top 40 keyboard shortcuts. I use these beauties every day to help me get my projects done faster. Now, you can use them, too. Even better, I've categorized them to make them easier to find. Haven't got FCPX yet? [Get your 90-day free trial here.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

(And, for those who take the time to count, you'll discover this list actually includes 53 keyboard shortcuts. But using "Top 40" in the title seemed so much sexier than "Top 53.")

## Create Stunning Videos: Best Collage Makers for iOS Devices

# Best Video Collage Apps for iPhone and iPad

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg)

##### Shanoon Cox

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

We all record more videos with our Smartphones or cameras than we can possibly share on social media, and we often don’t get the chance to show some of our favorite moments to our friends. Video collage apps for iPhones and iPads offer an easy solution to this problem because they enable you to merge multiple video clips into a single video. You don’t even need to have advanced video editing skills in order to create visually stunning video collages, as most of these apps are extremely easy to use. So in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best video collage apps of iOS devices.

## Best Free and Paid Video Collage Apps for iPhone and iPad

Even though selecting a video collage app isn’t a very complicated process, there are still a number of factors you need to consider before you choose to install a video collage app on your iPad or iPhone. Checking the list of features an app offers and making sure that it allows you to adjust each clip you include in a collage separately or to add music to your creations will help you determine if the app you’re interested in is the right choice for you. The selection of video collage presets or the border and background adjustment features should also be considered while choosing a video collage app. Let’s take a look at some of the best video collage apps you can find at the AppStore.

#### 1. [Video Collage and Photo Grid](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photogrid-video-collage-maker/id543577420)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 8 or later

![Video Collage Making Apps for iPhone & iPad ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-collage-and-photo-grid.jpg)

As its name suggests, this app allows you to create both photo and video collages. You can either use the existing material from your camera roll or use the Video Collage and Photo Grid app to capture new footage. You can choose from 64 fully customizable layouts and pick the texture or the color of the frames of each video or photo you include in the collage. The app also lets you adjust the sizes of the still and moving images you’re combining and it also offers the possibility to crop photos you’d like to use in your collages. The sound volume can be easily adjusted, but you must make an in-app purchase in order to unlock the background music feature.

#### 2. [PicPlayPost Movie Video Editor](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/picplaypost-video-editor/id498127541)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 10.3 or later

![PicPlayPost Movie Video Editor - Video Collage Making App ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/picplaypost-video-editor.jpg)

This versatile app can be used for much more than just creating video collages, as it offers the option to capture videos in Full HD and 4K resolutions, although the 4K option is only available on iPhone Xs and iPad Pro. Moreover, you can combine several video collages into a single video and apply a variety of transitions to ensure the smooth flow of the output video. Adding text layers, recording voiceovers or creating soundtracks for your video collages are just a few options you’ll have at your disposal if you install the PicPlayPost movie video editor on your iOS-based device. In case you’re planning on using this app on a daily basis, you should consider purchasing the Everything Pack that costs just $24.99\.

#### 3. [PicStich](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pic-stitch-collage-editor/id454768104)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 10.0 or later

![Video Collage Making Apps for iPhone & iPad ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pic-stitch-collage-editor.jpg)

The fact that PicStich offers more than 300 different layouts speaks volumes about its capabilities. However, the majority of the app’s features are designed to help you create photo collages. You can still add a song you like to a video collage to make it more entertaining to watch, but unfortunately, PicStich doesn’t let you apply transitions or adjust playback speeds of the videos you include in a video collage. Purchasing Frames and Borders packs will extend the scope of your options and enable you to increase the quality of the video collages you’re making. The app’s file-sharing capabilities are impressive since you can export your projects directly to Instagram or Dropbox and you can also share all of your creations to Facebook, Twitter, and other popular social networks.

#### 4. [PhotoGrid - Pic Collage Maker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photogrid-video-pic-editor/id543577420)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 10.0 or later

![Video Collage Making Apps for iPhone & iPad ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/photogrid-video-pic-editor.jpg)

We all record more videos with our Smartphones or cameras than we can possibly share on social media, and we often don’t get the chance to show some of our favorite moments to our friends. Video collage apps for iPhones and iPads offer an easy solution to this problem because they enable you to merge multiple video clips into a single video. You don’t even need to have advanced video editing skills in order to create visually stunning video collages, as most of these apps are extremely easy to use. So in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best video collage apps of iOS devices.

## Best Free and Paid Video Collage Apps for iPhone and iPad

Even though selecting a video collage app isn’t a very complicated process, there are still a number of factors you need to consider before you choose to install a video collage app on your iPad or iPhone. Checking the list of features an app offers and making sure that it allows you to adjust each clip you include in a collage separately or to add music to your creations will help you determine if the app you’re interested in is the right choice for you. The selection of video collage presets or the border and background adjustment features should also be considered while choosing a video collage app. Let’s take a look at some of the best video collage apps you can find at the AppStore.

#### 1. [Video Collage and Photo Grid](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photogrid-video-collage-maker/id543577420)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 8 or later

![Video Collage Making Apps for iPhone & iPad ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-collage-and-photo-grid.jpg)

As its name suggests, this app allows you to create both photo and video collages. You can either use the existing material from your camera roll or use the Video Collage and Photo Grid app to capture new footage. You can choose from 64 fully customizable layouts and pick the texture or the color of the frames of each video or photo you include in the collage. The app also lets you adjust the sizes of the still and moving images you’re combining and it also offers the possibility to crop photos you’d like to use in your collages. The sound volume can be easily adjusted, but you must make an in-app purchase in order to unlock the background music feature.

#### 2. [PicPlayPost Movie Video Editor](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/picplaypost-video-editor/id498127541)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 10.3 or later

![PicPlayPost Movie Video Editor - Video Collage Making App ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/picplaypost-video-editor.jpg)

This versatile app can be used for much more than just creating video collages, as it offers the option to capture videos in Full HD and 4K resolutions, although the 4K option is only available on iPhone Xs and iPad Pro. Moreover, you can combine several video collages into a single video and apply a variety of transitions to ensure the smooth flow of the output video. Adding text layers, recording voiceovers or creating soundtracks for your video collages are just a few options you’ll have at your disposal if you install the PicPlayPost movie video editor on your iOS-based device. In case you’re planning on using this app on a daily basis, you should consider purchasing the Everything Pack that costs just $24.99\.

#### 3. [PicStich](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pic-stitch-collage-editor/id454768104)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 10.0 or later

![Video Collage Making Apps for iPhone & iPad ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pic-stitch-collage-editor.jpg)

The fact that PicStich offers more than 300 different layouts speaks volumes about its capabilities. However, the majority of the app’s features are designed to help you create photo collages. You can still add a song you like to a video collage to make it more entertaining to watch, but unfortunately, PicStich doesn’t let you apply transitions or adjust playback speeds of the videos you include in a video collage. Purchasing Frames and Borders packs will extend the scope of your options and enable you to increase the quality of the video collages you’re making. The app’s file-sharing capabilities are impressive since you can export your projects directly to Instagram or Dropbox and you can also share all of your creations to Facebook, Twitter, and other popular social networks.
