You can **change the layout of the template** if you want to alter its original design and you can upload images from your computer or use **the Adobe Stock** option.

Photo Collage Maker lets you choose from more than **250 photo collage templates** that are suitable for virtually any purpose. The number of pictures you can include in a photo collage can vary from just **two to more than 75** and it depends on the template you choose. You can also automatically desaturate all the images in a photo collage by clicking on the **B&W/Color icon** or **change the background** with a single click. Photo Collage Maker doesn’t offer any border options, so you can’t really control the spacing between the images. Downloading a 1-megapixel file from this platform is going to cost you $5.56.
