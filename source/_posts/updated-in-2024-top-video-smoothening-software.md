## Part 1: What is Video Stabilization?

Video stabilization refers to algorithms that remove undesirable camera tremors and jitters caused by hand jiggling and the unintended camera panning to improve video quality.

Without affecting moving objects or purposeful camera panning, video stabilization technology is used to minimize visual quality loss by decreasing undesired shaking and twitches of an image/video capture equipment. This is especially important in portable imaging equipment, which is more susceptible to vibrations due to its smaller size.

Excessive hand wobbling and purposeful camera panning often result in inconsistent photos, while undesired camera position variations result in unstable image sequences. Video stabilization techniques maintain good visual clarity and steady video footage even under less-than-ideal settings.

It is not always feasible to re-enact a video, and in those cases, we must make amends with what we have. This approach will necessitate particular video stabilization software, which will increase the movie's transparency, allowing more innovation and modification.

## Part 1: What is Video Stabilization?

Video stabilization refers to algorithms that remove undesirable camera tremors and jitters caused by hand jiggling and the unintended camera panning to improve video quality.

Without affecting moving objects or purposeful camera panning, video stabilization technology is used to minimize visual quality loss by decreasing undesired shaking and twitches of an image/video capture equipment. This is especially important in portable imaging equipment, which is more susceptible to vibrations due to its smaller size.

Excessive hand wobbling and purposeful camera panning often result in inconsistent photos, while undesired camera position variations result in unstable image sequences. Video stabilization techniques maintain good visual clarity and steady video footage even under less-than-ideal settings.

It is not always feasible to re-enact a video, and in those cases, we must make amends with what we have. This approach will necessitate particular video stabilization software, which will increase the movie's transparency, allowing more innovation and modification.

To stream local files to TV from PC or Mac, there are totally 4 ways to choose from. Just get the 4 solutions below.

* [Solution 1: Cast Chrome browser to TV](#part1)
* [Solution 2: Cast with Wondershare Video Converter](#part2)
* [Solution 3: Cast with Plex for Chromecast](#part3)
* [Solution 4: Cast with Videostream for Google Chromecast](#part3)

## Solution 1: Cast Chrome browser to TV

![cast chrome browser to tv](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/chromecast/connect-chromecast.jpg)

### Step 1\. Install Chrome browser and Chromecast extension

Make sure that you have the latest version of Chrome. You can check by clicking Settings > About Google Chrome to update your chrome.

### Step 2: Connect Chromecast with TV

Plug in Chromecast in the HDMI input on your TV, and then plug the USB cord on the other end of the Chromecast to power it.

### Step 3.Connect WiFi

Make sure that your computer and TV are connected in the same network. You should be connected to 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi network.  
If your Chromecast can't be connected to the Wi-Fi network, please [check the Chromecast router compatibility here](https://support.google.com/chromecast/table/3477832?hl=en&ref%5Ftopic=3205565).

### Step 4.Install Google cast extension

[Please download Google cast extension here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-cast/boadgeojelhgndaghljhdicfkmllpafd?hl). After installation, there will be a Cast tab on the Chrome browser. You can click the option button to set video quality as Extreme (720p high bitrate) or High (720p) for your HD TV.

![cast from chrome browser](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/chromecast/cast-video.jpg)

### Step 5\. Play local Video or music

Drag your local files to chrome browser, or press Ctr + O to browse and import your files. And then your video will be played in Chrome's built-in video viewer. Then click the Cast current tab on your browser to stream media files to Chromecast and then play it on TV.

Also you can choose Cast entire screen to share your desktop screen instead of a Chrome tab to TV.

**Note:**

1\. If your videos can't be streamed, that's because Chromecast doesn't support these formats. [You can check all the supported media here](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/media). If you really want to cast any format, check the second solution.

2\. Stream video in background: When you stream video to your TV, you can use the 2 Windows short cuts to stream local video to Chromecast in background.  
Alt+Tab: It lets you do other things by switching to other opened programs/apps  
Ctrl+Esc: You can start a new program by pressing the 2 buttons to pop up the Star menu.

## Solution 2: Cast with Wondershare Video Converter

![stream files by video converter](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-converter-ultimate/stream-files-on-convert.jpg)

### Step 1\. Install Wondershare UniConverter

<

Download and install [Wondershare UniConverter Video Converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/videoconverter/download/) from its official website page.

### Step 2\. Import any video to the software

Make sure your Chromecast and PC are located in the same network. Then click the "Add Files" button or directly drag-n-drop to import your video to the program. After that, click the "Stream" pane on the right side and choose your Chromecast as the streaming device. When everything is ready, hit the "Stream" button at the bottom.

![cast from converter](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-converter-ultimate/start-streaming.jpg)

### Step 3\. Start streaming

In the pop up window, click the "Play To TV" button to stream your video to Chromecast. Then after a few seconds, you can enjoy your video right on the big screen. You can also control the playback process by clicking the perspective buttons in the streaming window. That's done!

## Solution 3: Cast with Plex for Chromecast

![plex chromecast](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/chromecast/plex-download.jpg)

Plex is a Chromecast app for PC, Mac and Linux. It is designed to stream local homemade videos and movies to your TV through Chromecast. To use this app, you need to subscribe the PlexPass and pay $4.99 for Plex app. After everything is prepared, just hit play and tap on the Chromecast button, and then your local videos can be successfully streamed to your TV. It supports MP4 and WebM.

More Information about [How to use Plex for Chromecast](https://plexapp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200264746-Quick-start-Step-by-Step).

## Solution 4: Cast with Videostream for Google Chromecast

![videostream chromecast](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/chromecast/videostream.jpg)

[Videostream](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/videostream-for-google-ch/cnciopoikihiagdjbjpnocolokfelagl?hl=en) for Google Chromecast is a free Chrome extension. To install it, the version of Chrome 32.0 is required. You can use it to free play local videos on Chromecast from your PC - Subtitles supported! Its supported format is MP4 and WebM.
