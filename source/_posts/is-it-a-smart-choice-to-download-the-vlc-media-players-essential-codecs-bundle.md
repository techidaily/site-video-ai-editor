## Should We Download VLC Codec Pack?

 _Posted by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last update: April 28, 2020_ 

**VLC codec packs** exit for certain video formats that cannot be played by VLC. It's true that VLC does not play everything, for instance the proprietary Indeo codecs and certain Blu-ray videos. But if that is your ultimate motive to get a VLC codec pack, we suggest otherwise.

#### **VLC Codec Packs, Should We Download Them?**

"If you want a stable OS, you don't install codec packs. "Though we cannot determine whether it is still true and we understand the existence of codec packs, for the sake of general security and stabilization, we do not recommend downloading VLC codec packs for the majority of people. 

First, [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) has almost every frequently-used codec built-in just in order to free our users from looking for endless codec packs. Why complicate the life yourself? Just update VLC media player to the latest version with renewed VLC codecs. VLC developers will for sure catch up with the latest and popular codecs and solve frequently prompted codec problems.

**VLC Video Codec Support:**

Second, to avoid uprising issues brought by VLC codec packs. All the codec packs including VLC codec packs, tend to bring about more issues than they solve, conflicting with other programs which may lead to computer crash, breeding adware and/or spyware. If you haven't encountered any of these issues, you just got sheer luck. 

#### **Do We Need VLC Codec Packs?**

Generally we do not necessarily need VLC codec packs. Why? Common video audio files can be easily played by VLC â€“the most powerful and open source media player. Well, one fringe circumstance that we can think of using VLC codec pack would be playing certain Blu-ray DVDs. Generally speaking, if you have a legal or proper [4K Blu-ray video player](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) you surely do not need a VLC codec pack since VLC can deal with plenty file formats and has good subtitle support. As for Indeo codecs, you can count on free and safe MPlayer which supports Indeo codecs (version 3/4/5).

The most controversial codec problem about VLC would be MKV codec support. Audio codecs like Real Audio is partially supported by VLC on Mac/Windows, while Midi codec is supported on VLC Windows yet not tested on Mac. If you are willing to visit the alternatives, you can try the likes of 5KPlayer, Mplayer, Potplayer, KMPlayer etc instead of downloading a VLC codec pack at risk.
