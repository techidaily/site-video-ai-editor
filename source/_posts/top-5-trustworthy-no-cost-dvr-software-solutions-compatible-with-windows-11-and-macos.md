**4\. Smart DVR Player to deal with Locked/Incomplete Files – GOM player**

**5\. Codec free DVR player – SMPlayer**

#### **Possible Reasons to DVR Playback Failure**

Before jumping into the bandwagon of DVR players for Windows 7/10/Mac, you should learn some basics about DVR and why some of it cannot be played via third-party software.

DVR/DVR-MS isn't so much a common video format as a proprietary format. Some of the DVR-MS videos are strictly copy protected by its content owner/manufacturer to ensure tamperproof like CCTV surveillance footage or [Netflix movie](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/youtube-download/) recordings, and thus are inherent not accessible on all accounts without authorization. Therefore, it is necessary that you find out the source of the DVR file and apply directly for the right to access DVR contents.
