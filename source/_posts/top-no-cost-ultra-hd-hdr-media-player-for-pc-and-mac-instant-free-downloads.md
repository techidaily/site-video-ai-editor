Watching HDR movies on computer? You will need a HDR-capable monitor, a HDR video player software and a computer with great specs regarding GPU, CPU, RAM. Here we offer you the second to none choice of an ideal **4K HDR player** software for Windows/Mac computer.

**What is HDR Content?**

HDR is the abbreviation for High-dynamic range. Briefly speaking, under this HDR effect, the luminosity range of video/image is extended so that more details in both highlights and shadows are able to be showed as if we are looking at the real thing. We are all familiar with HDR photo, HDR camera, HDR images, since HDR is rather an old concept that has been already used in photography (HDR imaging) and video games (HDR rendering). But it was until 2015 when Amazon Video offered HDR video using HDR10 Media Profile video that the HDR video was for its first time revealed in front of our video viewers. Now, there are mainly two HDR formats, namely HDR10 and Dolby Vision.

**4K HDR**  
 4K and HDR concepts are all great, but with the advent of 4K HDR (high dynamic range), about 10 million first-generation 4K sets may experience an extinction-level event, like its Ultra HD predecessor, 4K HDR -- which is known as Ultra HD Premium -- has 3840×2160 pixels, but with better luminosity adjustment.
