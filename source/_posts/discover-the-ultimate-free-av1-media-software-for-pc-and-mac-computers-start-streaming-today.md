 _Posted by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last update: September 30, 2020 | 3 Min Read_

Compared with other video codecs, AV1 is pretty a new codec since its 1.0.0 version just released in Feb. 2019\. Due to the short release time, AV1 codec is not as popular as other codecs, but because it is free and has its own advantages, many websites are going to use AV1 for transferring video. It is not surprising to download videos in AV1 online, but getting them to play on your own Windows or Mac PC is a vexing problem.

**Latest news:** NVIDIA’s GeForce RTX™ 30 Series GPUs has added AV1 hardware decoding support, Windows 10 will get AV1 Hardware-accelerated video support this fall and AMD RX 6000 Series GPUs will also support the AV1 Codec.

### Wiki: What Is AV1?

AV1 is the abbreviation of AOMedia Video 1, and it is an open and royalty-free video coding format. It is said that [AV1 codec](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) was developed because of the copyright license of HEVC is hard to get and to better handle high-resolution video. Compared with HEVC codec, [the compression efficiency of AV1 has gone by 30%](https://www.multichannel.com/blog/facebook-tests-show-av1-streaming-performance-exceeding-expectations). In any case, compressing video bound to cause a loss of quality, and despite the controversy that AV1 also supports lossless compression, there is no authoritative citation to confirm this. But after YouTube started using AV1 video codec on its site, Netflix also announced that it would use AV1 to transferring content on Android phones, we can make a reasonable conjecture that AV1 codec will be one of the most widely used formats in the future.
