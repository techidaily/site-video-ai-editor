### Wiki: What Is AV1?

AV1 is the abbreviation of AOMedia Video 1, and it is an open and royalty-free video coding format. It is said that [AV1 codec](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) was developed because of the copyright license of HEVC is hard to get and to better handle high-resolution video. Compared with HEVC codec, [the compression efficiency of AV1 has gone by 30%](https://www.multichannel.com/blog/facebook-tests-show-av1-streaming-performance-exceeding-expectations). In any case, compressing video bound to cause a loss of quality, and despite the controversy that AV1 also supports lossless compression, there is no authoritative citation to confirm this. But after YouTube started using AV1 video codec on its site, Netflix also announced that it would use AV1 to transferring content on Android phones, we can make a reasonable conjecture that AV1 codec will be one of the most widely used formats in the future.

If you are a Mac user, you need to find an AV1 codec or AV1 video tool to help.
