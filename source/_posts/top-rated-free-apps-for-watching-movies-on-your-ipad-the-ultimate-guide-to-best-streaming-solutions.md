Though one cannot play DVD disc on iPad directly, you can manage to play DVD content on iPad by **transferring DVD to iPad** and play it locally. This is exactly the idea behind DearMob iPhone Manager.

With built-in converter, this workaround "DVD player" for iPad (Pro 2/mini/air 2/air/3) auto converts DVD and directly transfers DVD to iPad/iPad Mini/iPad Pro/iPad Pro 2/iPhone given that DVD disc is ripped to iSO, MKV, AVI, MP4, RMVB etc. It reduces big video file size to 50% without quality loss on iPhone iPad and auto-rotate videos to fit iPad for full-screen playback. This iPad DVD player lets you import/export 4K or 1080p HD DVD videos & films between PC and iDevice, in batch as long as your iPad storage space is large enough.

Since you cannot plug an external DVD drive to iPad to play DVDs, the practical way to play DVD content on iPad would be import the DVD content and play on iPad. DearMob iPhone Manager sync the DVD videos to your device directly. You can drag and drop the DVD video file from computer to iPad iPhone without worrying iTunes/iDevices format compatibility.

![NO.4 iPad DVD Player - DVD Player Free](https://www.5kplayer.com/video-music-player/img/ipad-dvd-player-3.jpg) 

Here this iPad DVD Player FREE, developed by Floating Cube Studios seems much to the point of an authentic iPad DVD player without DVD ripping, DVD format conversion or DVD video transfer/streaming. As is advertised – it lets you **watch DVDs on your iPad and iPhone Live**. Just put a DVD into any Mac/Windows DVD drive, and one can watch DVD live on iPad iPhone. 

Note: There is another "DVD Player for iPad" app produced by the same company but it is very unworthy of the money according to the ratings. This iPad DVD player FREE app is now in apple apps store and you can download it to your iPad following the instructions to start your iPad DVD journey. 

Also note: some iPad DVD playback solution suggests that you use a video recorder to record the DVD video instead of ripping them. The problem here is you have to give in to the poor resolution and large file size.
