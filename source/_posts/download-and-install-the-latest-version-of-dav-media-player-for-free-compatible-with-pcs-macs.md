A DAV file is created by the SightBoss Central Station Software installed on a digital video recorder (DVR) such as DVR365, DVR-1600HP, DSD316, DSD304, DSD308, and used for recording videos captured by CCTV cameras. Incorporating the MPEG and H.264 compression methods, it is saved in an encrypted format and must be opened or played with a [DAV media player](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/).

### DAV Player - The Smartest Way to Open a DAV File
