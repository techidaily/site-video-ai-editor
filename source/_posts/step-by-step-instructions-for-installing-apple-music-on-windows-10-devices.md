Well before WWDC 2018, news about the revamped Apple Music Web Player has been buzzing around alongside the iOS 12 and macOS Mojave. Take a second look at it and you'll find Apple Music Web Player a simplified solution if you're looking for Apple Music Windows, up to now, a simple step like visiting **https://tools.applemusic.com/** is going to help listen to Apple Music on computer : Compared to full-fledged music client on Windows such as Spotify or Pandora, Apple Music Web Player allows its users to listen to full music releases on the web browser, instead of a short trial on Apple Music APP. 

However, if you're expecting more, like browsing category-wide catalog, or creating playlists, or seeing what your friends are streaming on Apple Music, the web player simply won't do. However, downloading music is just as easy as ABC if you stay with 5KPlayer, and the Apple Music Web Player let you enjoy the features of Apple Music on computer if you don't expect too much of it. 

### Part 2: Stream Apple Music from iPhone to Computer

This is less straight-forward, but if you already are an Apple Music user, and would like to play Apple Music on computer just once in a blue moon, staying with Apple's wireless music streaming function may satisfy you just well: By installing free 5KPlayer on computer, you may take the advantage of Apple's AirPlay function to stream Apple Music from iPhone to computer.

### Part 3: Stream Apple Music on Windows 10/7 through iTunes 12.2 (Newer)

From as early as 2015, Apple Music Windows was embedded into the iTunes software for Windows, for as long as you install the latest version of iTunes for your computer, a small-click on the "For You" tab can take you to the Apple Music Membership subscription interface. 

If you're already a registered Apple Music user, log in with your Apple ID and passcode can take to browse the library and listen to Apple Music on Windows 10 inside iTunes. If you're not yet a paid user, first-time registration gives you a 3-month Apple Music Windows 10 experience as the gift. 

Probably this is not an ideal choice in that iTunes for Windows is too space-consuming for any Windows users, if you're quite accustomed to iTunes' style of managing iPhone files, stay with iTunes to listen to Apple Music on Windows. If you don't use iTunes for other purposes aside from listening to Apple Music you'd better not choose this method as you do have better options such as the best Music Library Tool for Windows 10 and Mac – [5KPlayer](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/).
