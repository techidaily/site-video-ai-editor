## Best Chromebook Video Player Free Download to Play Media Files

 _Posted by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last update: April 28, 2020_

The native media player for Chromebook OS is not powerful as well as professional to play common media files smoothly. That's been proved by the complaints from various users about the playback errors of MP4, AVI, MKV, etc media files on Chromebook. Worse still, there are rare third-party video music players for Chrome OS to act as a good alternative when files are not playing on Chromebook.

Luckily, thanks to the arriving of Windows 10 on Chromebooks, media players for Windows 10 are also compatible with Google Chromebooks to play contents, and thus you will have many choices to choose an ideal **Chromebook video player** to play media files without troubles.

**"Unknown File Type" Error Message Occurs, That's Why We Need Professional Media Player for Chromebook**

Chromebooks are great but they lack the ability to play all kinds of media files if there is no matchable Chromebook video player installed. Often the case, when trying to open a file, you will get the "Unknown file type" error message to notify you that the file type isn't working on your Chromebook. On top of that error message, there are more to blame that make Chromebook a platform inappropriate for some media playback.

1\. Chromebook Chrome OS lacks the support for many media formats and codecs. As of now, the built-in Chromebook media player only plays:  
**Format:** 3GP, AVI, MOV, MP4, M4V, M4A, MP3, MKV, OGV, OGM, OGG, OGA, Webm, WAV  
**Codec:** Theora, VP8, VP9, H.264, MPEG4, Divx, Xvid, Opus, Vorbis, MP3, AAC, AMR-NB  
 2\. Interlaced video is not supported on some Chromebook models.  
 3\. Native media player for Chromebook has no full competence to recognize subtitle streams.

The limits to play media files of native Chromebook player may due to the ignoring of software improvement as Chrome OS is not a very popular operating system compared to Windows and macOS. Despite the fact, the requirements to a professional Chromebook video player from the minority should also get enough attention. With the arrival of Windows 10, here come more choices of applications like [media players for Windows 10](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) to Chromebook users. Thus, gaining an excellent video music player for Chromebook to play media files is realizable.
