#### **★ Solution 1\. Reset VLC Preferences Accordingly**

In case you do not know much information about your DVD, for example whether it is encrypted, DRM protected, or which protection tech and region code it uses, we compile the tried-and-true tutorials which are commonly used to troubleshoot VLC won't run DVD on Windows 10/Mac.

_Note: The first thing you should do is to check for update if your VLC is not playing DVD._

**Part 1 of Solution 1: Initiate DVD Playing Function of VLC**

**Steps:**   
 Launch VLC > Go to the first tab "Media" > Click "Open Disc" > Choose "DVD" in disc selection > Replay the DVD file

**Part 2 of Solution 1: Install Libdvdread, Libdvdnav & Libdvdcss**

Most commercial DVDs are encrypted by using a wide range of copy protection/encryption techs. To **play encrypted DVD** with VLC you must install libdvdread, libdvdnav, and libdvdcss which is the optional dependency for VLC to decode encrypted DVDs. 

**Step 1.** [Download the new libdvdread/libdvdnav/libdvdcss](http://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/);   
**Step 2.** Install the downloaded files (here we take libdvdcsss for Windows as an example):   
 \* Open the libdvdcsss-y.y.y.tar.gz (y.y.y is version number)   
 \* Find & enter the subdirectory libdvdcss-y.y.y   
 \* Execute the command:   
 ./configure   
 make   
 make install   
**Step 3.** Repeat above steps to get libdvdread and libdvdnav installed.

_Note: After installing, VLC will automatically use them when playing DVDs._

**Part 3 of Solution 1: ADD Keydb And Libaacs** 

Some users found that VLC can't **play bluray DVD** due to the lack of AACS and BD + DRM libraries and keys. So if you are unable to play a bluray DVD, try the following steps:

**For Windows users:**   
**Step 1.** Download the keydb.cfg and libaacs;  
**Step 2.** Navigate to "C:Users/your username/AppData" > Create a folder named aacs in "AppData" directory > Place the keydb.cfg file in aacs directly;  
**Step 3.** Go to "C: Program Files" > Open "VLC" directory > Drag the downloaded libaacs.dll file to it.

#### **★ Solution 2: Resort to VLC Alternative Media Player**

VLC is far from the only media player you can use to play DVDs on Windows 10 and Mac, and there are numerous free standalone [DVD player software](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) with integrated support for DVDs, for example **5KPlayer**.

#### **★ Solution 3: Rip DVD to VLC Compatible Formats**

If you have no fancy for VLC media player alternatives and stick to VLC, you can try DVD rippers to rip DVD to VLC compatible formats. Here I sincerely recommend the popular [WinX DVD Ripper](https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/dvd-ripper-platinum/) \- a fastest free DVD ripper for Windows (10) to rip DVD to MP4, AVI, FLV, MOV, WMV, etc. and convert DVD to iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Android with customized profiles.
