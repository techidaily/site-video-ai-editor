Just try the steps below.  
_Note: The first thing you should do is to check for update if your VLC is not playing DVD._

 Launch VLC > Tap "Help" in the menu bar > select "Check for Updates" to install the latest version of VLC.

If you are using the latest version of VLC and still can't play DVD with it, do as follows:

**Part 1 of Solution 1: Initiate DVD Playing Function of VLC**

**Steps:**   
 Launch VLC > Go to the first tab "Media" > Click "Open Disc" > Choose "DVD" in disc selection > Replay the DVD file

**Part 2 of Solution 1: Install Libdvdread, Libdvdnav & Libdvdcss**

Most commercial DVDs are encrypted by using a wide range of copy protection/encryption techs. To **play encrypted DVD** with VLC you must install libdvdread, libdvdnav, and libdvdcss which is the optional dependency for VLC to decode encrypted DVDs. 

**Step 1.** [Download the new libdvdread/libdvdnav/libdvdcss](http://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/);   
**Step 2.** Install the downloaded files (here we take libdvdcsss for Windows as an example):   
 \* Open the libdvdcsss-y.y.y.tar.gz (y.y.y is version number)   
 \* Find & enter the subdirectory libdvdcss-y.y.y   
 \* Execute the command:   
 ./configure   
 make   
 make install   
**Step 3.** Repeat above steps to get libdvdread and libdvdnav installed.

[\>>See how to install libdvdcss for Mac OS X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpBo8nbycRw)

_Note: After installing, VLC will automatically use them when playing DVDs._

**Part 3 of Solution 1: ADD Keydb And Libaacs** 

Some users found that VLC can't **play bluray DVD** due to the lack of AACS and BD + DRM libraries and keys. So if you are unable to play a bluray DVD, try the following steps:

**For Windows users:**   
**Step 1.** Download the keydb.cfg and libaacs;  
**Step 2.** Navigate to "C:Users/your username/AppData" > Create a folder named aacs in "AppData" directory > Place the keydb.cfg file in aacs directly;  
**Step 3.** Go to "C: Program Files" > Open "VLC" directory > Drag the downloaded libaacs.dll file to it.

#### **★ Solution 2: Resort to VLC Alternative Media Player**

VLC is far from the only media player you can use to play DVDs on Windows 10 and Mac, and there are numerous free standalone [DVD player software](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) with integrated support for DVDs, for example **5KPlayer**.

#### **★ Solution 3: Rip DVD to VLC Compatible Formats**

If you have no fancy for VLC media player alternatives and stick to VLC, you can try DVD rippers to rip DVD to VLC compatible formats.
