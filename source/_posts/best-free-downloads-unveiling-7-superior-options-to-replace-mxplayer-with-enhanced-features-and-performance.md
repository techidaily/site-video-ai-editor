## 1\. VLC – top notch alternative to MX video Player on several platform

VLC has more features baked with its already advanced core engine.

For beginners or those who are about going in-depth with certain needs like YouTube playback/download or 8/10bit HEVC decoding, this player with hefty multimedia features would not be as good as those dedicated media player Mac apps.

## 3\. Mplayer - best MX player alternative on Linux

The best convenience is that users can easily fast forward or backward a video by sliding the mouse wheel. In comparison with Potplayer and SMplayer which are the second/third choices after VLC with better interface, Mplayer seldom crashes! Smart, capable of dealing with HD videos and H.264 decoding!
