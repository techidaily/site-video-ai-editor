### \[Solved\] Netflix Won't Play Issue 1: Netflix Connection Problem

Frequent rebuffering or loading, problems starting the Netflix app, or trouble playing a movie or TV show are the most common Netflix connection problems. If you encounter above Netflix errors, you may suffer a slow or interrupted internet connection that is keeping you from smooth streaming. To resolve this Netflix wont play error, try the steps below:  
\*Restart your home network

Alternatively, you can choose a better Netflix wont play solution 5KPlayer for smooth playback, be it in lesser stable network or not. 5KPlayer plays and streams movies/TV shows on Netflix from 300+ online sites smoothly and seamlessly.

### \[Solved\] Netflix Won't Stream Issue 2: DRM Error

Getting a "Digital Rights Management (DRM) Error" with code like N8156-6003, N8156-6013, N8156-6023? The tried-and-true Netflix DRM troubleshooting approaches are:  
\*Right click on your web browser icon and select "Run as Administrator"  
\*Search for "mspr.hds" on you Mac/PC and rename it to "mspr.old" or directly delete it  
_**Tips**: Deleting "mspr.hds" file will reset any media that has been purchased and assigned to your computer. You may even lose the right to play your purchased music. So we strongly suggest to rename it instead of deleting it._  
\*Uninstall and re-install Silverlight plug-in.
