### \[Solved\] Netflix Won't Stream Issue 2: DRM Error

Getting a "Digital Rights Management (DRM) Error" with code like N8156-6003, N8156-6013, N8156-6023? The tried-and-true Netflix DRM troubleshooting approaches are:  
\*Right click on your web browser icon and select "Run as Administrator"  
\*Search for "mspr.hds" on you Mac/PC and rename it to "mspr.old" or directly delete it  
_**Tips**: Deleting "mspr.hds" file will reset any media that has been purchased and assigned to your computer. You may even lose the right to play your purchased music. So we strongly suggest to rename it instead of deleting it._  
\*Uninstall and re-install Silverlight plug-in.
