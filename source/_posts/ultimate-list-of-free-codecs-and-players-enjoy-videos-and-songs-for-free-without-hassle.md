### FAQ: What is a Codec?

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codec): A codec is a device or computer program which encodes or decodes a digital data stream or signal. Codec is a portmanteau of coder-decoder or compressor-decompressor. A coder encodes a data stream or a signal for transmission or storage, possibly in encrypted form, and the decoder function reverses the encoding for playback or editing. Codecs are used in video conferencing, streaming media, and video editing applications.

Codecs are often divided into lossless codec and lossy codecs. Lossless codecs are often used for archiving data in a compressed form while retaining all information. The media uses lossless codecs can be further processed as the quality won’t degrade significantly. However, it surely will cost more storage capacity and network bandwidth. Lossy codecs, as the term suggests, will reduce quality in order to maximize compression. But, it will reduce cost and improve performance when data is transmitted.
