If you are ready with two videos and now want to bring them to the same screen then prefer to follow these simple steps:

#### Step 2: Add PIP videos

It is time to choose the higher video clip so that the PIP effect can be applied. This task can be done either by using on-screen type controls available on the viewer or you can move ahead with transform controls available on the inspector.
