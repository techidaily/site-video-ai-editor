## How to Play 4K UHD Videos on Windows 10 PC without Lag?

 _Posted by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last update: July 18, 2019_

Speaking of **how to play 4K video on Windows 10** successfully, the first thing you should make clear is what a 4K video is? Simply put, 4K has four times the number of pixels of the 1080p HD, thus it can render much higher image definition and more details of a video than the 1080p resolution. If you use a professional 4K video player for Windows 10 like 5KPlayer to play 4K UHD videos on your Windows 10 PC, the viewing experience would be much greater than before.

### How to Play 4K Videos on Windows 10 PC Smoothly?

4K resolution never ends with what we commonly see, say 3840 x 2160 or 4096 x 2160 pixels. Actually, any resolution with a horizontal pixel count of about 4,000 can be 4K resolution, thus 4K resolution can also be 4096 x 3112, 3656 x 2664, 4096 x 1714 or 3996 x 2160 pixels. Besides, 4K UHD contents could be downloaded from online, ripped from DVDs or recorded by iPhone, GoPro, cameras or camcorders. Now that 4K resolutions and 4K videos are variable, your [4K video player](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) should be quite powerful to the whole types of 4K UHD contents on Windows 10 computer without lag.

If you intend to play 4K video on Windows 10 with the default Windows Media Player, chances are that you may be disappointed by the poor performance of Windows Media Player when playing 4K UHD videos. Windows Media Player totally can't play H.264 and doesn't include the codecs required for FLAC, FLV and many other files, so Windows Media Player probably can't play 4K videos in MP4, MKV, MOV and more. So, you should turn to other 4K video player for Windows 10 like [5KPlayer](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/) for successful 4K UHD playback.

Kindly remind, besides the 4K UHD video player is the priority you should think of, you should make sure that your Windows 10 computer is not that old as well. A 64-bit Windows 10 computer with a 4K-compatible monitor and HDMI 2.0 cable is better for smooth 4K video playback with great clarity.
