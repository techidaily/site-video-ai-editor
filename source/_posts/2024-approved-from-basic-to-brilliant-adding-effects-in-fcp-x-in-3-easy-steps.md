There are two broad categories of effects in Final Cut Pro X: Inspector effects and Effects Browser effects.

I've written previously about how to use Inspector effects to create a [picture-in-picture](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) effect, among many other effects available to us in Final Cut Pro. In this article, I want to show you how to apply an effect to a clip, modify that effect, temporarily turn that effect on or off, or delete it entirely.

This is a basic tutorial about Apple Final Cut Pro X, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). This is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out. Download the free trial version below.

## How to Apply Effects to Video in Final Cut Pro X

* [Find and apply an effect](#part1)
* [Modify an effect](#part2)
* [Disable and delete an effect](#part3)
* [Extra credit](#part4)

#### Find and apply an effect

Here is our clip - a fearsome polar bear.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx001.jpg "add effects in fcp")

To apply an effect, first select the clip in the Timeline.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx002.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Then, click this icon in the Toolbar to open the Effects Browser (or type Cmd + 5).

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx003.jpg "add effects in fcp")

The Browser, like all the effects browsers, lists categories of effects on the left, a search box at the bottom to use for searching for the names of effects, and effects for each category on the right.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx004.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Here, for example, I've selected the Blur category, with my cursor near the Gaussian blur effect. (Gaussian blur is the best effect to use when you want a clip to look blurry.)

To apply an effect, do one of two things:

* Drag the effect from the Browser onto the clip you want to change.
* If the clip, or clips, are selected, double-click the effect in the Browser to apply it.

#### Modify an effect

To modify an effect, click this icon in the Toolbar to open the Inspector (or type Cmd + 4).

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx005.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Click the Video tab in the Inspector. Effects from the Effects Browser are always listed at the top of the Inspector.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx006.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Grab a slider and drag it to see what happens. For example, to make an image blurrier, drag the Amount slider to the right. To lessen the effect, drag it to the left.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx007.jpg "add effects in fcp")

#### Disable and delete an effect

To temporarily disable an effect, without deleting it, click the blue box so that it turns gray.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx008.jpg "add effects in fcp")

To enable an effect, click the gray box so it turns blue again.

To delete an effect, click the name of the effect - in this example: Gaussian - and press the big Delete key.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx009.jpg "add effects in fcp")

The effect will be deleted from the selected clip.

#### Extra credit

You can apply, modify, even delete the same effect to multiple clips by first selecting all the clips you want to change in the Timeline then adding, changing the settings, or deleting an effect in the Inspector.

#### Summary

The process of applying effects is the same for all effects you apply from the Effects Browser. In future articles I'll show you how to use this technique to create a wide variety of different effects in Final Cut Pro X.

Previously we’ve talked about the [Best green screen editors](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) in which there’re 2 green screen software especially for Mac users: iMovie and Final Cut Pro.

Be sure to enable green screen function in iMovie! Check this tutorial about [How to Use iMovie Green Screen Effect.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**What we like:**

#### 2. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/)

iMovie is a free video editing software for vloggers who using Mac to edit vidoes. It is equipped with an array of fantastic and practical video editing features, iMovie is an idea video editing tool for anyone. Comes with every new iMac, it's free of charge and provides a wide range of effects and tools sets, thus it's always considered as an essential tool for any Mac user to enhance their vologs.

Despite a somewhat limited scope of video editing features iMovie provides, the software is still powerful enough to enable you to edit footage captured in resolutions up to **4K** . Additionally, you can [create titles](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [apply visual effects and filters](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to video clips, or even record your own voiceovers. iMovie’s file sharing capabilities are perfectly suited for vlogging as you can upload a video to your YouTube channel or Facebook account directly from the software.

**What we like:**

Moreover, the software supports nearly all common image and[video file formats](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) , which means that you can record your vlog entries with any digital camera. The best part is that VSDC enables its users to export videos in HD and 4K resolutions directly to YouTube. The only downside is that you can **only install this vlog editor on a PC computer.**

**What we like:**

Anyone without previous knowledge can use this tool

**What we don’t like:**

Sometimes errors appear when opening the software

#### 4. [GoPro Quik Desktop app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quik-gopro-video-editor/id694164275?mt=8)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows and MacOS

If you're traveling around the world and spend a lot of time on the road shooting videos with a GoPro action camera, then you can try using the Quik desktop app to edit your vlog videos. The Quik video editor is perfectly optimized for editing footage captured with different models of GoPro cameras, but the amount of video editing options the app provides can be a bit underwhelming for professionals. This is a great option if the laptop you carry with you on your journeys doesn’t have enough processing power to run a more powerful video editing software. However, if you rarely use GoPro cameras to record your footage, then this video editing app won’t have a lot to offer you.

**What we like:**

It offers cloud storage

**What we don’t like:**

Some good features are paid and expensive

#### 5. [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve)

**Price:** Free and premium version

**Compatibility:**  Windows and MacOS

Tools like Filmora and Adobe Premiere are full of great features, but these blessings come with a price. That’s why people love working on DaVinci, as most of its features are free. The good thing is that you can do all sorts of video editing using this software. While this editor is awesome for vlogs, it is already under significant usage in the Hollywood industry.

Although this software has a premium version with additional features, I have found everything I looked for in the free version. That includes color grading, animations, text, and effects. Moreover, it has a customizable and easy interface. But to be honest, you will find it a bit tricky at first. Also, you might need to watch some YouTube tutorials to get started with DaVinci Resolve.

**What we like:**

Complete video production tool with audio post-production options

**What we don’t like:**

4K video editing requires a premium version

#### 6. [VN Video Editor](https://www.vlognow.me/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows OS

Not many people have heard this name, but VN Video Editor is the best tool for cross-platform operating systems, including iOS and Android. You can also download this tool on your Mac and Windows.

Another fantastic thing about this software is that it’s free and doesn’t even leave a visible watermark on the edited stuff. Furthermore, it doesn’t demand any heavy system requirements whether you’re using it on a smartphone or computer.

You can use this tool on an Apple laptop or computer by downloading this tool from the Apps Store. However, the problem is that you can’t directly download VN Video Editor on your Windows PC. You have to go through a bit of struggle to use it on your system. First, you need to download BluesSacks and then search and install VN Video Editor through Google Play. Here’s a video for your reference.

So, is this struggle worth doing it? Let’s be realistic! I won’t tell you that you can edit an entire Christopher Nolan movie with it, but as a vlogging tool, this has almost everything you will need to make cool videos.

**What we like:**

No watermark and easy to use

**What we don’t like**

No direct download link

Not meant for professional editors

#### 7. [VideoPad](https://www.nchsoftware.com/videopad/index.html)

**Price:**  Free and premium version

**Compatibility:**  Mac and Windows OS

Despite being an old tool, VideoPad is still known to be an excellent pick if you’re looking for free editing software for vlogging. It has a simple interface and is extremely easy to use. Anyone with a bit of interest and knowledge can start editing videos without learning from tutorials.

In my experience, this software is almost similar to Filmora regarding easiness. However, compared to Filmora, it lacks some essential presets. Besides, the interface looks old. But it doesn’t mean that this tool lacks some modern traits.

Furthermore, the editor allows you to export videos in multiple formats, making it great for YouTube videos.

**What we like:**

The free version includes lots of exciting features

Affordable upgrade

**What we don’t like:**

Unable to export mp4 and limited audio tracks in free version

The seemingly endless collection of tools, visual effects, and animation features will ensure that each video you edit in Adobe Premiere Pro meets the highest professional standards.

A broad spectrum of video editing options grants you the creative freedom to visualize any idea, regardless of how complex that idea may be. However, if you are new to Final Cut Pro, you will   **need a lot of practice in order to be able to utilize its capabilities entirely.**

![final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/final-cut-pro-x.jpg "final cut pro")

It features the drag-n-drop functions and offers almost all the classic video editing functions including trim, rotate, split, combine as well as adding music track, filters, and themes. The windows movie maker is simple yet the function is limited. After you editing one or two vlog videos with it, you will find that.

However,   **Windows Movie Maker** has been discontinued, and it is no longer available for download, but if you are using an older version of the Windows 7 operating system, you can still edit your videos with this iconic PC-based software.

Windows Movie Maker never had much to offer to skilled video editors, so if you take vlogging seriously, you won’t spend too much time editing your videos with it.

**What we like:**

Totally free for windows users and the automatic video creation feature is interesting

**What we don’t like:**

Video Editing Features are limited

Only for Windows users

#### 2. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** MacOS and iOS

iMovie is a free video editing software for vloggers who using Mac to edit vidoes. It is equipped with an array of fantastic and practical video editing features, iMovie is an idea video editing tool for anyone. Comes with every new iMac, it's free of charge and provides a wide range of effects and tools sets, thus it's always considered as an essential tool for any Mac user to enhance their vologs.

Despite a somewhat limited scope of video editing features iMovie provides, the software is still powerful enough to enable you to edit footage captured in resolutions up to **4K** . Additionally, you can [create titles](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [apply visual effects and filters](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to video clips, or even record your own voiceovers. iMovie’s file sharing capabilities are perfectly suited for vlogging as you can upload a video to your YouTube channel or Facebook account directly from the software.

**What we like:**

Totally free for Mac users and you can also use it on iPhone or iPad to edit vlog videos

**What we don’t like:**

Limited features and effects

#### 3. [VSDC Free Video Editor](http://www.videosoftdev.com/free-video-editor)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows

This non-linear editor seems to be a perfect solution for both established and aspiring vloggers because it offers a lot of video editing tools that are incredibly easy to use. Moreover, the software supports nearly all common image and[video file formats](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) , which means that you can record your vlog entries with any digital camera. The best part is that VSDC enables its users to export videos in HD and 4K resolutions directly to YouTube. The only downside is that you can **only install this vlog editor on a PC computer.**

**What we like:**

Anyone without previous knowledge can use this tool

**What we don’t like:**

Sometimes errors appear when opening the software

#### 4. [GoPro Quik Desktop app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quik-gopro-video-editor/id694164275?mt=8)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows and MacOS

If you're traveling around the world and spend a lot of time on the road shooting videos with a GoPro action camera, then you can try using the Quik desktop app to edit your vlog videos. The Quik video editor is perfectly optimized for editing footage captured with different models of GoPro cameras, but the amount of video editing options the app provides can be a bit underwhelming for professionals. This is a great option if the laptop you carry with you on your journeys doesn’t have enough processing power to run a more powerful video editing software. However, if you rarely use GoPro cameras to record your footage, then this video editing app won’t have a lot to offer you.

**What we like:**

It offers cloud storage

**What we don’t like:**

Some good features are paid and expensive

#### 5. [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve)

**Price:** Free and premium version

**Compatibility:**  Windows and MacOS

Tools like Filmora and Adobe Premiere are full of great features, but these blessings come with a price. That’s why people love working on DaVinci, as most of its features are free. The good thing is that you can do all sorts of video editing using this software. While this editor is awesome for vlogs, it is already under significant usage in the Hollywood industry.

Although this software has a premium version with additional features, I have found everything I looked for in the free version. That includes color grading, animations, text, and effects. Moreover, it has a customizable and easy interface. But to be honest, you will find it a bit tricky at first. Also, you might need to watch some YouTube tutorials to get started with DaVinci Resolve.

**What we like:**

Complete video production tool with audio post-production options

**What we don’t like:**

4K video editing requires a premium version

#### 6. [VN Video Editor](https://www.vlognow.me/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows OS

Not many people have heard this name, but VN Video Editor is the best tool for cross-platform operating systems, including iOS and Android. You can also download this tool on your Mac and Windows.

Another fantastic thing about this software is that it’s free and doesn’t even leave a visible watermark on the edited stuff. Furthermore, it doesn’t demand any heavy system requirements whether you’re using it on a smartphone or computer.

You can use this tool on an Apple laptop or computer by downloading this tool from the Apps Store. However, the problem is that you can’t directly download VN Video Editor on your Windows PC. You have to go through a bit of struggle to use it on your system. First, you need to download BluesSacks and then search and install VN Video Editor through Google Play. Here’s a video for your reference.

So, is this struggle worth doing it? Let’s be realistic! I won’t tell you that you can edit an entire Christopher Nolan movie with it, but as a vlogging tool, this has almost everything you will need to make cool videos.

**What we like:**

No watermark and easy to use

**What we don’t like**

No direct download link

Not meant for professional editors

#### 7. [VideoPad](https://www.nchsoftware.com/videopad/index.html)

**Price:**  Free and premium version

**Compatibility:**  Mac and Windows OS

Despite being an old tool, VideoPad is still known to be an excellent pick if you’re looking for free editing software for vlogging. It has a simple interface and is extremely easy to use. Anyone with a bit of interest and knowledge can start editing videos without learning from tutorials.

In my experience, this software is almost similar to Filmora regarding easiness. However, compared to Filmora, it lacks some essential presets. Besides, the interface looks old. But it doesn’t mean that this tool lacks some modern traits.

Furthermore, the editor allows you to export videos in multiple formats, making it great for YouTube videos.

**What we like:**

The free version includes lots of exciting features

Affordable upgrade

**What we don’t like:**

Unable to export mp4 and limited audio tracks in free version

#### 8\. [VideoProc Vlogger](https://www.videoproc.com/video-editing-software/)

VideoProc Vlogger is specially designed for vlogging. It is great for both beginners and professionals. It has an easy interface and options with lots of unique features, including 28 motion presets, pan & zoom, and motion cropping.

A few more features of VideoProc Vlogger include fisheye removal, time-lapse, split screen, green screen, text addition, voice recording, audio extractor, and more.

**What we like:**

Free tech – support

Minor issues with clips splitting

#### 3. [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere/free-trial-download.html)

Adobe Premiere is one of the best video editing apps ever created, if not the best, so if you’re looking for a reliable video editor with plenty of advanced video editing features, this is probably your best choice. The seemingly endless collection of tools, visual effects, and animation features will ensure that each video you edit in Adobe Premiere Pro meets the highest professional standards.

![Premiere Pro interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/premiere-pro-interface.jpg)

Vloggers in need of a powerful video editing app that is capable of performing even the most demanding video editing tasks will benefit from purchasing Adobe Premiere Pro as a single app or as a part of some other Creative Cloud plan.

It also supports many[third-party plug-ins](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for additional features.

That’s why it is hardly surprising that the Final Cut’s latest update is among the best vlog video editors you can use in 2020\. A broad spectrum of video editing options grants you the creative freedom to visualize any idea, regardless of how complex that idea may be. However, if you are new to Final Cut Pro, you will   **need a lot of practice in order to be able to utilize its capabilities entirely.**

![final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/final-cut-pro-x.jpg "final cut pro")

Final Cut Pro is a sophisticated [video editing program for professionals](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/videoconverter/download/).

#### 4. [GoPro Quik Desktop app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quik-gopro-video-editor/id694164275?mt=8)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows and MacOS

If you're traveling around the world and spend a lot of time on the road shooting videos with a GoPro action camera, then you can try using the Quik desktop app to edit your vlog videos. The Quik video editor is perfectly optimized for editing footage captured with different models of GoPro cameras, but the amount of video editing options the app provides can be a bit underwhelming for professionals. This is a great option if the laptop you carry with you on your journeys doesn’t have enough processing power to run a more powerful video editing software. However, if you rarely use GoPro cameras to record your footage, then this video editing app won’t have a lot to offer you.

**What we like:**

It offers cloud storage

**What we don’t like:**

Some good features are paid and expensive

#### 5. [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve)

**Price:** Free and premium version

**Compatibility:**  Windows and MacOS

Tools like Filmora and Adobe Premiere are full of great features, but these blessings come with a price. That’s why people love working on DaVinci, as most of its features are free. The good thing is that you can do all sorts of video editing using this software. While this editor is awesome for vlogs, it is already under significant usage in the Hollywood industry.

Although this software has a premium version with additional features, I have found everything I looked for in the free version. That includes color grading, animations, text, and effects. Moreover, it has a customizable and easy interface. But to be honest, you will find it a bit tricky at first. Also, you might need to watch some YouTube tutorials to get started with DaVinci Resolve.

**What we like:**

Complete video production tool with audio post-production options

**What we don’t like:**

4K video editing requires a premium version

#### 6. [VN Video Editor](https://www.vlognow.me/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows OS

Not many people have heard this name, but VN Video Editor is the best tool for cross-platform operating systems, including iOS and Android. You can also download this tool on your Mac and Windows.

Another fantastic thing about this software is that it’s free and doesn’t even leave a visible watermark on the edited stuff. Furthermore, it doesn’t demand any heavy system requirements whether you’re using it on a smartphone or computer.

You can use this tool on an Apple laptop or computer by downloading this tool from the Apps Store. However, the problem is that you can’t directly download VN Video Editor on your Windows PC. You have to go through a bit of struggle to use it on your system. First, you need to download BluesSacks and then search and install VN Video Editor through Google Play. Here’s a video for your reference.

So, is this struggle worth doing it? Let’s be realistic! I won’t tell you that you can edit an entire Christopher Nolan movie with it, but as a vlogging tool, this has almost everything you will need to make cool videos.

**What we like:**

No watermark and easy to use

**What we don’t like**

No direct download link

Not meant for professional editors

In my experience, this software is almost similar to Filmora regarding easiness. However, compared to Filmora, it lacks some essential presets. Besides, the interface looks old. But it doesn’t mean that this tool lacks some modern traits.

Furthermore, the editor allows you to export videos in multiple formats, making it great for YouTube videos.

**What we like:**

The free version includes lots of exciting features

Affordable upgrade

**What we don’t like:**

Unable to export mp4 and limited audio tracks in free version

Not many people have heard this name, but VN Video Editor is the best tool for cross-platform operating systems, including iOS and Android. You can also download this tool on your Mac and Windows.

Another fantastic thing about this software is that it’s free and doesn’t even leave a visible watermark on the edited stuff. Furthermore, it doesn’t demand any heavy system requirements whether you’re using it on a smartphone or computer.

You can use this tool on an Apple laptop or computer by downloading this tool from the Apps Store. However, the problem is that you can’t directly download VN Video Editor on your Windows PC. You have to go through a bit of struggle to use it on your system. First, you need to download BluesSacks and then search and install VN Video Editor through Google Play. Here’s a video for your reference.

So, is this struggle worth doing it? Let’s be realistic! I won’t tell you that you can edit an entire Christopher Nolan movie with it, but as a vlogging tool, this has almost everything you will need to make cool videos.

**What we like:**

No watermark and easy to use

**What we don’t like**

No direct download link

Not meant for professional editors

#### 7. [VideoPad](https://www.nchsoftware.com/videopad/index.html)

**Price:**  Free and premium version

**Compatibility:**  Mac and Windows OS

Despite being an old tool, VideoPad is still known to be an excellent pick if you’re looking for free editing software for vlogging. It has a simple interface and is extremely easy to use. Anyone with a bit of interest and knowledge can start editing videos without learning from tutorials.

In my experience, this software is almost similar to Filmora regarding easiness. However, compared to Filmora, it lacks some essential presets. Besides, the interface looks old. But it doesn’t mean that this tool lacks some modern traits.

Furthermore, the editor allows you to export videos in multiple formats, making it great for YouTube videos.

**What we like:**

The free version includes lots of exciting features

Affordable upgrade

**What we don’t like:**

Unable to export mp4 and limited audio tracks in free version

A few more features of VideoProc Vlogger include fisheye removal, time-lapse, split screen, green screen, text addition, voice recording, audio extractor, and more.

**What we like:**
