![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step2.png)

**Step 03:** Place both of these videos into the timeline. Make sure to place your reaction above.

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step3.png](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step3.png)

**Step 04:** Select your reaction video on the timeline and go to the "Effects". Here you will find a new folder named "AI Portrait", open it. Here you will find multiple AI portrait effects.

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step4.png)

**Step 05:** Our goal is to remove the background of the reaction. To do that, we will use Human Segmentation. Drag and drop Human Segmentation into the reaction video. If you haven't purchased this effect already, it will ask you to buy it to export the video. But you want to try it first, click on "Try It."

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step5](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step5.png)

**Step 06:** Once the effect is successfully applied to the video, its background will be removed automatically.

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step6](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step6.png)

**Step 07:** Adjust the video by making it smaller and place it in the bottom left corner of the screen. Your reaction video is ready to be uploaded on video-sharing platforms.

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step7](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step7.png)

**Step 08:** To make your video look cool and stunning, you can also add multiple other effects to your reaction. AI portrait allows you to add a border around the character to make it look more visible and separate it from another video. Go to the AI portrait and drag Human Border Effect and drop it into your reaction. It will create an outline around the character and make it look more visible.

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step8](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step8.png)

**Step 09:** In some instances, you might need to change the position or size of your reaction. You can easily do that by applying the Keyframes to it. If you feel like changing the part of your reaction at some point in the video, go to that point in the timeline and click on the keyframe button above the timeline.

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step9.png)

**Step 10:** Once you click on the keyframe, it will add a keyframe to the video. Now move forward into the timeline to a point and adjust your character's position by dragging it. Let's move it to the bottom right corner. It will add another keyframe to the video in the timeline. Now the character will change its position from the left corner to the right corner once it reaches that specific point in time.

 Reaching the widest audience possible is the goal of every video content creator, but achieving this goal might be impossible if the videos you share online are not saved in the right file format. [MP4](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is probably the most common video file there is, because it is compatible with a broad range of [media players](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), as well as [online video hosting](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and social media platforms.

 WebM, on the other hand, is perfectly suited for videos that are viewed from Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, but only a handful of desktop-based media players offer support for this video file format. That is why in this article we are going to take a look at the 10 best WebM to MP4 converters on the market.

## The 10 Best WebM to MP4 Converters

[Changing the format of a video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) file is never a complicated process, regardless of the software or the [web-based application](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you are using. However, the duration, speed, and quality of the conversion process depend on the converter you’ve selected for this task. Here are the ten best WebM to MP4 converters that make the file conversion process swift and smooth.

The amount of time you will have to wait for the conversion process to be completed varies on the desktop and online versions of UniConverter, and you can only convert two WebM files to MP4 at the same time with the online version of this file converter.

 Afterward, you should click on the Add button and proceed to import the WebM file into the media player, and then click on the Browse button in order to specify the location on your hard drive where the converted file is going to be saved.

## WebM vs MP4: Which Video File Format is Better?

 The file format in which a video is saved determines its compatibility with different media players. So, if your videos are only going to be played in web-browsers like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, then it is better to save your video in WebM file format.

 However, you should keep in mind that this file format isn’t used often outside of the online context and that finding a media player that is compatible with the WebM format can be a challenge. MP4 video files, on the other hand, can be played in virtually any macOS or Windows-based media player or uploaded to YouTube or any other video hosting service. That’s why MP4 is a more appealing option to video content creators who want to ensure that their videos can be played anywhere regardless of the device or the media player that is being used to open them.

**Conclusion**

 Changing a video’s file format in 2020 no longer requires you to have access to a professional video editing software, because there are countless online file conversion platforms, that enable you to complete this process in just a couple of clicks. Even so, most online solutions limit the maximum size of the video files you can convert with them, which is why it is better to choose one of the desktop-based options if you are working with large video files.

## WebM vs MP4: Which Video File Format is Better?

 The file format in which a video is saved determines its compatibility with different media players. So, if your videos are only going to be played in web-browsers like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, then it is better to save your video in WebM file format.

 However, you should keep in mind that this file format isn’t used often outside of the online context and that finding a media player that is compatible with the WebM format can be a challenge. MP4 video files, on the other hand, can be played in virtually any macOS or Windows-based media player or uploaded to YouTube or any other video hosting service. That’s why MP4 is a more appealing option to video content creators who want to ensure that their videos can be played anywhere regardless of the device or the media player that is being used to open them.

**Conclusion**

 Changing a video’s file format in 2020 no longer requires you to have access to a professional video editing software, because there are countless online file conversion platforms, that enable you to complete this process in just a couple of clicks. Even so, most online solutions limit the maximum size of the video files you can convert with them, which is why it is better to choose one of the desktop-based options if you are working with large video files.
