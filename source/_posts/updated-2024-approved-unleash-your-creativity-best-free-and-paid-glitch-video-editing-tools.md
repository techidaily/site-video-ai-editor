 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

We live in the digital age, which is the reason why the topic of malfunctioning electronics is close to us. Most of us have seen TV static, a monitor glitch, or some other fault of a display more than once, and it is hardly surprising that a growing number of filmmakers and video content creators refer to glitches in their work.

Glitches can be used in the opening titles, as transitions or effects that are applied to an entire video, but you need to fit them into the right context since glitches don’t match all styles of videos. You are at the right place if you want to find out more about glitch video editors because in this article we are going to introduce you to some of the best glitch video editors on the market.

## The Best Glitch Video Editors \[Online & Desktop\]

Virtually any video editing software can be used to create a glitch effect, but you should keep in mind that only some video editors feature glitch effects in their effects libraries. Choosing a video editing software that already has preset glitch effects will make it easier for you to use these effects in different projects. Let’s take a look at some of the best glitch video editors.

### 1\. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Filmora is a versatile video editor that enables you to do much more than just apply glitch effects to videos. In fact, it allows you to manipulate your footage in virtually any way you want by giving you access to huge titles, effects, and transitions libraries and allowing you to use a broad range of video editing tools. Filmora let's use glitch effects in all of your projects, so here’s how you can use glitch effects in videos you edit in Filmora.

[![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 1\.  How to create a glitch transition with Filmora?

If you are using Filmora X V10.5 and the later versions, you can now find the glitch transitions in the program. To locate the glitch transition, type glitch in the transition search bar and you will find all glitch-related transitions in the library, such as VHS and glitch effect, retro game intro pack transition, and VFX cyberpunk pack transition.

![Filmora Glitch transitions ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-glitch-transitions.jpg)

However, there are no glitch transitions in Filmora’s transition library if you are running versions before V10.5, you can use the Chromatic Aberration effect for this purpose.

All you need to do is to place two different video clips onto the timeline and then go to the Effects tab. Expand the Filters menu and click on the Distortion submenu. The Chromatic Aberration effect is located near the top of the tab, so just drag and drop it to the video track that is directly above the one to which you added the footage.

![Filmora Glitch  effects ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-chromatic-aberration-glitch-effects.jpg)

You should then reduce the effect’s duration to six or eight frames, and you can enlarge the timeline to perform this task with more precision. Once you’ve adjusted the duration of the effect, you should place it above the cut, so that it covers the last four frames of the ending video clip and the first two frames of the video clip that is starting.

[Adding a sound effect](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that matches the glitch transition you created is going to draw the viewer’s attention to the transition and make it more realistic.

You can watch the video tutorial below to get the step-by-step video tutorial or read this article to find out [how to add glitch effects to video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 2\. How to add the glitch effect to text in Filmora?

The process of adding a glitch effect to text is simple, although you need to go through several different steps. You should start by choosing one of the available titles from Filmora’s Title tab and placing it on the timeline.

Double-click on the title you added, then click on the Advanced button and insert the text into the textbox. Proceed to set the text color to white, adjust its size and select a new font and then make sure that the No Animation option is selected in the Animation tab.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

 Click OK to confirm the changes you’ve made, then lock the video track on which the title is located, copy the title to the video track above and unlock the video track you locked. Once you’ve created the second title, you should double-click on the first title and change the text color to black.

Make a cut at two seconds on the title you copied and then head over to the Transition tab to locate the Deposit Up transition. Drag the Deposit Up transition from the Transition tab and drop it over the beginning of the title you copied. Export this title from Filmora as a video and then import it back into your project.

Remove the titles you added to the timeline and proceed to place the footage on the timeline. Afterward, you should place the video clip you created directly above the first video and match their durations. Double-click on the video clip that contains text and change the Blending Mode to Lighten from the Compositing menu.

Proceed to add the Shake, Flip, and Chromatic Aberration effects to the overlaying clip and then go to the Video Effects menu that is located in the Video tab to adjust the settings of the effects you applied.

#### 3\. How to apply a glitch effect to a video with Filmora?

The fastest way to apply a glitch effect in Filmora to a video clip is to add the Chromatic Aberration effect to it. Combining the Chromatic Aberration effect with filters, 3D LUTs and audio effects will help you sell the effect better.

Which combination of Filmora’s visual effects you are going to use, ultimately depends on the type of glitch effect you want to create. Optionally, you can also use keyframes to introduce the changes you make more gradually. Filmora offers you plenty of ways to get creative with glitch effects, but it is up to you to find the best way to incorporate glitch effects into your videos.

If you are using the Filmora V10.5 and later version, you can add the Human Glitch effect under AI Portrait category, which will leave the video background without glitch effects.

![Filmora AI Portrait Human Glitch  effects ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/human-glitch-effect-ai-portrait.jpg)

### 2\. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** macOS

Unfortunately, iMovie doesn’t have any preset glitch effects in its effects library, but you can still use it to create a glitch effect from scratch. The Video Overlay settings, Clip Filter options as well as the Split Screen feature enable you to overlay video clips and simulate the glitch effect.

Creating a glitch effect with iMovie requires you to have excellent video editing skills, and quite a bit of creativity as you have to plan the entire effect in advance. Even so the video editing tools you will have at your disposal are going to be limited so you shouldn’t expect to achieve breathtaking results. Adding an audio effect that accompanies the glitch effect may make this effect look more realistic.

### 3. [Veed.io](https://www.veed.io/)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $15 per month

**Compatibility:** web-based

Veed.io is an online photo and video editor aimed at social media content producers that lets you apply preset glitch effects to your videos. You don’t even have to create an account in order to start working on a new project, and you can simply upload a video clip of any length to this platform.

As soon as the upload is completed, you will be taken to the editor window where you can adjust the video’s settings, add text overlays or change the video’s playback speed. Click on the Effects tab that is located in the Filters menu and then proceed to choose between VHS, Glitch, and RGB Split effects. All you need to do in order to apply one of these glitch effects is to click on it and you can see the results immediately in the Preview window. However, all videos you create with the free version of Veed.io are going to be watermarked.

### 4. [Photo Mosh](https://photomosh.com/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** web-based

This online platform is entirely dedicated to the creation of glitch videos. Besides being incredibly fun to use, Photo Mosh is also completely free, so you just have to upload a video clip and start experimenting with different effects.

Bad TV, Duo Tone, or Pixelate are just a few among numerous glitch effects you can choose from. Simply expand the effect and click on the ON checkbox to apply an effect and then proceed to adjust its settings. Optionally, you can click on the Mosh button that is located below the Preview Screen if you want to combine two or more random glitch effects. The only downside is that you can only save your creations as JPEG, GIF, or WEBM files, and the videos you record in the WEBM format can last for a few seconds.

### 5. [Biteable](https://biteable.com/)

**Price:** Free, pricing plans start at $19.00 per month

**Compatibility:** web-based

Bitable is an online content creation platform that helps digital marketers and all other types of content creators to edit their videos quickly. The platform features a huge selection of video templates that can be used for a wide variety of purposes that range from employee onboarding to business to customer messages.

Unsurprisingly, Bitable features a Glitch template that is composed out of eight scenes that can be used to promote a concert or a nightclub. This template is customizable which enables you to upload the images you want to use and your tailored promotional message or alter the theme colors. You can also choose the soundtrack for the glitch video by simply uploading the song you want to use. However, if you opt for Biteable’s Starter pack you won’t be able to export more than one video per month.

### 6. [Renderforest](https://www.renderforest.com/)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $9.99 per month

**Compatibility:** web-based

In case you are looking for an online platform that enables you to build websites, edit videos, create animations, and design logos, then Renderforest is the right choice for you. Like Biteable, Renderforest grants you access to a huge collection of video templates you can use to create videos quickly.

The Glitch Slideshow template can be used for video portfolios, party highlights, or virtually any other occasion. You just have to upload the footage you want to include in the glitch slideshow, add the text and choose the song for the soundtrack and Renderforest will generate the new video for you. You can only create three-minute videos at 360p resolution if you decide to use the free version of this platform, and all videos you export from Renderforest are going to be watermarked if you don’t purchase one of the available subscriptions models.

### 7. [Shotcut](https://shotcut.org/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS, Linux

Creating glitch videos with Shotcut is easy because this open-source video editor allows you to choose from several different glitch effects. The effect named Glitch is located in the Filters menu and you just have to drag and drop it to the timeline in order to apply it to a video clip. In addition, you can adjust the Frequency, Block height, Shift intensity, and Color intensity options if you want to customize the effect to the project’s demands.

The RGB Shift is yet another effect you can use to create glitches in your videos. After you apply it to a video clip you can adjust the vertical and horizontal values, but keep in mind that setting both of these values to 50 is going to align them perfectly and render them invisible. Moreover, filters such as Shake, Old Film Projector, or Old Film Technicolor can all be used to simulate glitches in a video.

### 8. [VSDC](http://www.videosoftdev.com/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows

PC owners who want to add glitch effects to their videos can install the VSDC video editing software for free. This non-linear editing application supports nearly all common video file formats, so you don’t have to worry about the format in which your video was captured.

After you create a new project and add the footage to the timeline, you should click on the Video Effects button and select the Glitch option from the Special FX submenu. There are eight glitches presets to choose from, and you can either use one of them or create your own glitch presets. You can adjust the Glitch effect’s settings from the Properties Window. Click on the Properties drop-down menu in the Glitch Effect Settings submenu and choose one of the available options or pick the Custom option if you want to create a new glitch effect preset.

### FAQ About Glitch Video Editors

#### 1\. What is a glitch effect?

A glitch effect can be any intervention you make on a video clip that makes that video look like it was recorded by a faulty camera or displayed on a malfunctioning display device. That’s why you don’t necessarily have to use a glitch effect in order to make the video clip look damaged since a color effect or a camera shake effect can also be used for this purpose. Moreover, combining several effects to create a glitch in a video is also an option, although this task may be overwhelming for inexperienced video editors.

#### 2\. How to apply a glitch effect to a video in Filmora

Filmora allows you to use glitches in a variety of ways, so besides adding the Chromatic Aberration effect to a video clip, you can also use it to create a transition or apply it to text. In addition, you can use a camera shake effect or filters to make glitches in your videos. Including the sound effect that accompanies the glitch can help you create a more realistic glitch.

**Conclusion**

Glitch effects have become very popular in the last few years, which is the reason why a growing number of content creators is using them in their videos.

Filmora is a versatile video editor that enables you to do much more than just apply glitch effects to videos. In fact, it allows you to manipulate your footage in virtually any way you want by giving you access to huge titles, effects, and transitions libraries and allowing you to use a broad range of video editing tools. Filmora let's use glitch effects in all of your projects, so here’s how you can use glitch effects in videos you edit in Filmora.

[![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 1\.  How to create a glitch transition with Filmora?

If you are using Filmora X V10.5 and the later versions, you can now find the glitch transitions in the program. To locate the glitch transition, type glitch in the transition search bar and you will find all glitch-related transitions in the library, such as VHS and glitch effect, retro game intro pack transition, and VFX cyberpunk pack transition.

![Filmora Glitch transitions ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-glitch-transitions.jpg)

However, there are no glitch transitions in Filmora’s transition library if you are running versions before V10.5, you can use the Chromatic Aberration effect for this purpose.

All you need to do is to place two different video clips onto the timeline and then go to the Effects tab. Expand the Filters menu and click on the Distortion submenu. The Chromatic Aberration effect is located near the top of the tab, so just drag and drop it to the video track that is directly above the one to which you added the footage.

![Filmora Glitch  effects ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-chromatic-aberration-glitch-effects.jpg)

You should then reduce the effect’s duration to six or eight frames, and you can enlarge the timeline to perform this task with more precision. Once you’ve adjusted the duration of the effect, you should place it above the cut, so that it covers the last four frames of the ending video clip and the first two frames of the video clip that is starting.

[Adding a sound effect](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that matches the glitch transition you created is going to draw the viewer’s attention to the transition and make it more realistic.

#### 2\. How to add the glitch effect to text in Filmora?

The process of adding a glitch effect to text is simple, although you need to go through several different steps. You should start by choosing one of the available titles from Filmora’s Title tab and placing it on the timeline.

Double-click on the title you added, then click on the Advanced button and insert the text into the textbox. Proceed to set the text color to white, adjust its size and select a new font and then make sure that the No Animation option is selected in the Animation tab.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

 Click OK to confirm the changes you’ve made, then lock the video track on which the title is located, copy the title to the video track above and unlock the video track you locked. Once you’ve created the second title, you should double-click on the first title and change the text color to black.

Make a cut at two seconds on the title you copied and then head over to the Transition tab to locate the Deposit Up transition. Drag the Deposit Up transition from the Transition tab and drop it over the beginning of the title you copied. Export this title from Filmora as a video and then import it back into your project.

Remove the titles you added to the timeline and proceed to place the footage on the timeline. Afterward, you should place the video clip you created directly above the first video and match their durations. Double-click on the video clip that contains text and change the Blending Mode to Lighten from the Compositing menu.

Proceed to add the Shake, Flip, and Chromatic Aberration effects to the overlaying clip and then go to the Video Effects menu that is located in the Video tab to adjust the settings of the effects you applied.

#### 3\. How to apply a glitch effect to a video with Filmora?

The fastest way to apply a glitch effect in Filmora to a video clip is to add the Chromatic Aberration effect to it. Combining the Chromatic Aberration effect with filters, 3D LUTs and audio effects will help you sell the effect better.

Which combination of Filmora’s visual effects you are going to use, ultimately depends on the type of glitch effect you want to create. Optionally, you can also use keyframes to introduce the changes you make more gradually. Filmora offers you plenty of ways to get creative with glitch effects, but it is up to you to find the best way to incorporate glitch effects into your videos.

If you are using the Filmora V10.5 and later version, you can add the Human Glitch effect under AI Portrait category, which will leave the video background without glitch effects.

![Filmora AI Portrait Human Glitch  effects ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/human-glitch-effect-ai-portrait.jpg)

### 2\. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** macOS

Unfortunately, iMovie doesn’t have any preset glitch effects in its effects library, but you can still use it to create a glitch effect from scratch. The Video Overlay settings, Clip Filter options as well as the Split Screen feature enable you to overlay video clips and simulate the glitch effect.

Creating a glitch effect with iMovie requires you to have excellent video editing skills, and quite a bit of creativity as you have to plan the entire effect in advance. Even so the video editing tools you will have at your disposal are going to be limited so you shouldn’t expect to achieve breathtaking results. Adding an audio effect that accompanies the glitch effect may make this effect look more realistic.

### 3. [Veed.io](https://www.veed.io/)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $15 per month

**Compatibility:** web-based

Veed.io is an online photo and video editor aimed at social media content producers that lets you apply preset glitch effects to your videos. You don’t even have to create an account in order to start working on a new project, and you can simply upload a video clip of any length to this platform.

Click on the Effects tab that is located in the Filters menu and then proceed to choose between VHS, Glitch, and RGB Split effects. All you need to do in order to apply one of these glitch effects is to click on it and you can see the results immediately in the Preview window. However, all videos you create with the free version of Veed.io are going to be watermarked.

### 4. [Photo Mosh](https://photomosh.com/)

This online platform is entirely dedicated to the creation of glitch videos. Besides being incredibly fun to use, Photo Mosh is also completely free, so you just have to upload a video clip and start experimenting with different effects.

Bad TV, Duo Tone, or Pixelate are just a few among numerous glitch effects you can choose from. Simply expand the effect and click on the ON checkbox to apply an effect and then proceed to adjust its settings. Optionally, you can click on the Mosh button that is located below the Preview Screen if you want to combine two or more random glitch effects. The only downside is that you can only save your creations as JPEG, GIF, or WEBM files, and the videos you record in the WEBM format can last for a few seconds.

### 5. [Biteable](https://biteable.com/)

**Price:** Free, pricing plans start at $19.00 per month

**Compatibility:** web-based

Bitable is an online content creation platform that helps digital marketers and all other types of content creators to edit their videos quickly.

Unsurprisingly, Bitable features a Glitch template that is composed out of eight scenes that can be used to promote a concert or a nightclub. This template is customizable which enables you to upload the images you want to use and your tailored promotional message or alter the theme colors. You can also choose the soundtrack for the glitch video by simply uploading the song you want to use. However, if you opt for Biteable’s Starter pack you won’t be able to export more than one video per month.

### 6. [Renderforest](https://www.renderforest.com/)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $9.99 per month

**Compatibility:** web-based

In case you are looking for an online platform that enables you to build websites, edit videos, create animations, and design logos, then Renderforest is the right choice for you. Like Biteable, Renderforest grants you access to a huge collection of video templates you can use to create videos quickly.

The Glitch Slideshow template can be used for video portfolios, party highlights, or virtually any other occasion. You just have to upload the footage you want to include in the glitch slideshow, add the text and choose the song for the soundtrack and Renderforest will generate the new video for you. You can only create three-minute videos at 360p resolution if you decide to use the free version of this platform, and all videos you export from Renderforest are going to be watermarked if you don’t purchase one of the available subscriptions models.

### 7. [Shotcut](https://shotcut.org/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS, Linux

Creating glitch videos with Shotcut is easy because this open-source video editor allows you to choose from several different glitch effects. The effect named Glitch is located in the Filters menu and you just have to drag and drop it to the timeline in order to apply it to a video clip. In addition, you can adjust the Frequency, Block height, Shift intensity, and Color intensity options if you want to customize the effect to the project’s demands.

The RGB Shift is yet another effect you can use to create glitches in your videos. After you apply it to a video clip you can adjust the vertical and horizontal values, but keep in mind that setting both of these values to 50 is going to align them perfectly and render them invisible. Moreover, filters such as Shake, Old Film Projector, or Old Film Technicolor can all be used to simulate glitches in a video.

### 8. [VSDC](http://www.videosoftdev.com/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows

PC owners who want to add glitch effects to their videos can install the VSDC video editing software for free. This non-linear editing application supports nearly all common video file formats, so you don’t have to worry about the format in which your video was captured.

After you create a new project and add the footage to the timeline, you should click on the Video Effects button and select the Glitch option from the Special FX submenu. There are eight glitches presets to choose from, and you can either use one of them or create your own glitch presets. You can adjust the Glitch effect’s settings from the Properties Window. Click on the Properties drop-down menu in the Glitch Effect Settings submenu and choose one of the available options or pick the Custom option if you want to create a new glitch effect preset.

### FAQ About Glitch Video Editors

A glitch effect can be any intervention you make on a video clip that makes that video look like it was recorded by a faulty camera or displayed on a malfunctioning display device.

Moreover, combining several effects to create a glitch in a video is also an option, although this task may be overwhelming for inexperienced video editors.

#### 2\. How to apply a glitch effect to a video in Filmora

Filmora allows you to use glitches in a variety of ways, so besides adding the Chromatic Aberration effect to a video clip, you can also use it to create a transition or apply it to text.

We live in the digital age, which is the reason why the topic of malfunctioning electronics is close to us. Most of us have seen TV static, a monitor glitch, or some other fault of a display more than once, and it is hardly surprising that a growing number of filmmakers and video content creators refer to glitches in their work.

Glitches can be used in the opening titles, as transitions or effects that are applied to an entire video, but you need to fit them into the right context since glitches don’t match all styles of videos. You are at the right place if you want to find out more about glitch video editors because in this article we are going to introduce you to some of the best glitch video editors on the market.

## The Best Glitch Video Editors \[Online & Desktop\]

## The Ultimate FCPX Troubleshooting Resource: 2023 Edition

# Troubleshooting Tips for Final Cut Pro X

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg)

##### Benjamin Arango

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Most of the time, Final Cut Pro X works great. But, when it doesn't, here are some things you can try to get your system back to normal in no time.

Here's the quick list:

* [Quit and restart Final Cut Pro](#part1)
* [Check your media](#part2)
* [Delete render files and re-render](#part3)
* [Create a new library](#part4)
* [Create a new user account](#part5)
* [Trash FCP X Preferences](#part6)
* [Remove and re-install Final Cut Pro](#part7)

#### 1 Quit and restart Final Cut Pro

Restarting Final Cut releases and refreshes memory so that if something was confusing your system, restarting Final Cut can fix it.

![restart fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/restart.png "restart fcp")

#### 2 Check your media

![check your media](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/image-size.png "check your media")

Frequently, problems are caused by still images that are too big. Limit your digital photos to no more than 5,000 pixels on a side. Final Cut is a video editor, not a still image editor. Images that are too large cause problems.

Also, stock footage files are known to cause problems. Be sure to convert all stock footage to ProRes 422 before importing into Final Cut Pro X.

#### 3 Delete render files and re-render

Open your Project in the Timeline and choose File > Delete Project Render Files. Render files can become corrupt. Trashing them forces Final Cut to create new render files which often will fix the problem.

#### 4 Create a new library

Create a new library and a new project. Then, copy and paste sections of the old project into the new project. Test each section until you find the spot that doesn't work. At which point, you can remove or replace the bad media.

![Create a new library](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/new-project.png "Create a new library")

#### 5 Create a new user account

![Create a new user account](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/new-ccount.png "Create a new user account")

Open System Preferences > Accounts and create a new User Account. This resets all preferences for both Final Cut and the operating system back to factory defaults. The only problem with doing this is that a new user account can't access files stored in the Home directory of the old user account. For this reason, I always recommend storing all libraries on external hard drives, not the Home Directory.

#### 6 Trash FCP X Preferences

Trash Final Cut Pro X preference files. There are at least three preference files and, if you've had a crash, there can be more. Here are the steps:

* Go to the Finder.
* Hold down on the Option key and click on the Go menu. The Library folder inside your Home Directory now shows up as a selection inside this menu. (You could also type Shift+Command+G, or select Go > Go To Folder in the Finder; then, type \~/Library/ and click Go.)
* Open to the Library > Preferences folder.
* Trash com.apple.FinalCut.LSSharedFileList.plist
* Trash com.apple.FinalCut.plist
* Trash com.apple.FinalCut.UserDestinations.plist
* Trash any other files that start with "com.apple.finalcut".
* Empty the Trash.
* Restart Final Cut Pro X.

#### 7 Remove and reinstall Final Cut Pro

If all else fails, delete FCPX from the Applications folder and re-install it from the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/final-cut-pro/id424389933?mt=12).

One of these techniques should fix your problem. If not, it's time to contact [Apple Support](http://www.apple.com/support/).

Most of the time, Final Cut Pro X works great. But, when it doesn't, here are some things you can try to get your system back to normal in no time.

Here's the quick list:

* [Quit and restart Final Cut Pro](#part1)
* [Check your media](#part2)
* [Delete render files and re-render](#part3)
* [Create a new library](#part4)
* [Create a new user account](#part5)
* [Trash FCP X Preferences](#part6)
* [Remove and re-install Final Cut Pro](#part7)

#### 1 Quit and restart Final Cut Pro

Restarting Final Cut releases and refreshes memory so that if something was confusing your system, restarting Final Cut can fix it.

![restart fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/restart.png "restart fcp")

#### 2 Check your media

![check your media](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/image-size.png "check your media")

Frequently, problems are caused by still images that are too big. Limit your digital photos to no more than 5,000 pixels on a side. Final Cut is a video editor, not a still image editor. Images that are too large cause problems.

Also, stock footage files are known to cause problems. Be sure to convert all stock footage to ProRes 422 before importing into Final Cut Pro X.

#### 3 Delete render files and re-render

Open your Project in the Timeline and choose File > Delete Project Render Files. Render files can become corrupt. Trashing them forces Final Cut to create new render files which often will fix the problem.

#### 4 Create a new library

Create a new library and a new project. Then, copy and paste sections of the old project into the new project. Test each section until you find the spot that doesn't work. At which point, you can remove or replace the bad media.

![Create a new library](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/new-project.png "Create a new library")

#### 5 Create a new user account

![Create a new user account](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/new-ccount.png "Create a new user account")

Open System Preferences > Accounts and create a new User Account. This resets all preferences for both Final Cut and the operating system back to factory defaults. The only problem with doing this is that a new user account can't access files stored in the Home directory of the old user account. For this reason, I always recommend storing all libraries on external hard drives, not the Home Directory.

#### 6 Trash FCP X Preferences

Trash Final Cut Pro X preference files. There are at least three preference files and, if you've had a crash, there can be more. Here are the steps:

* Go to the Finder.
* Hold down on the Option key and click on the Go menu. The Library folder inside your Home Directory now shows up as a selection inside this menu. (You could also type Shift+Command+G, or select Go > Go To Folder in the Finder; then, type \~/Library/ and click Go.)
* Open to the Library > Preferences folder.
* Trash com.apple.FinalCut.LSSharedFileList.plist
* Trash com.apple.FinalCut.plist
* Trash com.apple.FinalCut.UserDestinations.plist
* Trash any other files that start with "com.apple.finalcut".
* Empty the Trash.
* Restart Final Cut Pro X.

#### 7 Remove and reinstall Final Cut Pro

If all else fails, delete FCPX from the Applications folder and re-install it from the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/final-cut-pro/id424389933?mt=12).

##### What Should Consider when You Convert MP3 into MP4

An easy yet powerful editor

Numerous effects to choose from

Detailed tutorials provided by the official channel

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Keeping in mind that there will of course be no actual imagery to go with the finished product (unless you choose to add as such), converting an **MP3 into MP4** is very easy!

There are even online **MP3 to MP4 converters** that will allow you to do this without having to download or install anything! But, we're getting ahead of ourselves here. Continue reading below to learn more:

#### In this article

01 [Easy Steps on Convert MP3 into MP 4](#Part 1)

02 [Six Online and Free Mp3 to Mp4 Converter](#Part 2)

## Part 1 **Easy Steps on Convert MP3 into MP4**

For the first part of this article, we'll be covering how to use a **free** **MP3 to MP4 converter** in order to successfully change the format of your audio into a video file! There will be two examples given for this, one for the straightforward **MP3 into MP4** conversion the other for the more specified **MP3 to MOV** conversion!

### 01How to Convert MP3 to MP4?

**Step 1: Launch MP3 to MP4 Convert (for Windows)**

For our example, we'll be using the **free MP3 to MP4 converter**, EaseUS Video Converter! This is open-source software, so you can use it for free!

To start using your chosen **free MP3 to MP4 converter**, upload the file that you want to convert! For our example converter, it's as simple as dragging and dropping your chosen MP3 into the interface (as pointed out in the image below.)

![Launch MP3 to MP4 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%201.png)

**Step 2: Choose Output Format!**

Once the MP3 file has been uploaded, choose your desired output format.

(For our example **MP3 to MP4 converter**, this means selecting the settings icon for the file in question and then choosing a format from the pop-up window that appears (shown in the image below).

![Choose MP4 Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%202.png)

**Step 3: Start Converting!**

Once you've chosen your desired output format (which in this case is **MP3 into MP4**), select the "CONVERT" button to finish up!

![Convert MP3 into MP4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%203.png)

**Step 4: Save MP3 Into MP4**

Depending on your chosen **free MP3 to MP4 converter**, your new MP4 file may have to be downloaded manually or not.

In the case of EaseUS Video Converter, it is downloaded automatically, all you have to do is select the "Finished" tab and select "OPEN" to go directly to the file location.

![Open Finished MP4 File](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%204.png)

### 02How to Convert MP3 to MOV?

We've also included how you can convert **MP3 to MOV** with the same tool! As you will surely see, much of the process is the same. Only one step is really changed!

**Step 1: Uploaded MP3 File!**

First, just like in the previous section, upload your MP3 file (by dragging and dropping the file onto the **MP3 to MOV** converter.)

![Choose Files for Upload](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%205.png)

**Step 2: Select 'MOV' Format!**

This is the step where things change, of course! Now, rather than choosing MP4, you should select the "MOV" format for your output type! This will ensure that your MP3 file is converted specifically to a MOV file.

![Select MOV output format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%206.png)

**Step 3: Convert!**

Again, just like before, select "CONVERT" to start the conversion process from **MP3 to MOV**!

![Select Conver or Convert All](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%207.png)

**Step 4: Open Folder to Find File!**

Then, finally, go to the "Finished" tab to find your new MOV file.

![Finished Conversions Tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%208.png)

## Part 2 **Six Online and Free Mp3 to Mp4 Converter**

For this next section, we're going to introduce a couple of **online MP3 to MP4 converters** as well other general, paid, and **free MP3 to MP4 converters** that you can check out. A link to a video showing how the converter works, as well as brief descriptions for each converter, have also been provided to ensure that you have a good idea of how each one works!

### 01**[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

The first of the tools on this list is Filmora! Filmora, first and foremost, is an advanced video editor. Some might say that using it as a tool to simply convert **MP3 into MP4** is a little bit of an overkill.

But, chances are, you're not likely going to want to stop at converting your MP3 into an MP4 file anyway, right? Well, if that's the case, then having an all-in-one tool on your side that can offer you endless options for all sorts of purposes is one way to ensure that you are starting off on the right foot from the very beginning!

### 02Zamzar

Zamzar is a Windows 10 app that works as a general conversion tool. It doesn't just convert **MP3 into MP4** or **MP3 into MOV** — it also does the job if you're looking for a converter that will work on JPG to PNG or PDF to JPG, etc. That makes it a helpful tool to have on hand just for general conversion purposes.

### 03Online File Converter

Online File Converter, as you can probably guess from the name, is an online conversion tool! This tool, much like Zamzar, is a heavy-hitter when it comes to conversion inputs and outputs compatibility. So, not only are you able to do the general **MP3 into MP4** conversion promised today, but you can do other things as well! Plus, no download or installation is required! All you need is an internet connection to access the website the converter is on and a little patience while you wait to upload, convert, and download the file in question.

### 04Any Conv

AnyConv is an alternate to the Online File Converter if you're looking for an online solution, but you don't like the interface of one or the other. The two are pretty much identical in terms of features. All you need to do in order to use it is to upload the file that you want to convert, choose a format, and then download the output file when you're done!

### 05Uniconverter

Uniconverter is an online **MP3 to MP4** tool from Wondershare (the same creators of Filmora Pro). It's a very solid tool. And it's quite a convenient one too. Since, just like any online converter, all you need to start using it is an internet connection.

### 06MConverter - Chrome Extension

Our last pick brings us back to unique solutions! Specifically, we're delving into the realm of Chrome extensions! This tool, the MConverter, works similarly to the other converters on this list. But, of course, in this case, if you want to use it in order to convert your files, you must first download the plug-in to your Chrome browser!

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** Despite the variety of options out there for **MP3 into MP4** converters, they all pretty much work the same. First, you upload the file that you want to convert. Second, you select the output format for the conversion. And finally, third, you finish the conversion!

**●** Most MP3 to MP4 converters work for other formats as well. For example, if you want to convert your **MP3 to MOV** instead — that's possible! OR, if you want to do the opposite, and convert **MP4 to MP3**, that works too!

**●** The difference between the different audio-to-video converters is usually the type of extra features it comes with as well as from what platform you can use it. For the latter, there are software types that you download and install to your computer, online types that you access through the internet, and extensions that you plug into your browser! Pick the one that works best with your workflow.

Depending on your chosen **free MP3 to MP4 converter**, your new MP4 file may have to be downloaded manually or not.

### 01**[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

The first of the tools on this list is Filmora! Filmora, first and foremost, is an advanced video editor. Some might say that using it as a tool to simply convert **MP3 into MP4** is a little bit of an overkill.

But, chances are, you're not likely going to want to stop at converting your MP3 into an MP4 file anyway, right? Well, if that's the case, then having an all-in-one tool on your side that can offer you endless options for all sorts of purposes is one way to ensure that you are starting off on the right foot from the very beginning!

### 02Zamzar

Zamzar is a Windows 10 app that works as a general conversion tool. It doesn't just convert **MP3 into MP4** or **MP3 into MOV** — it also does the job if you're looking for a converter that will work on JPG to PNG or PDF to JPG, etc. That makes it a helpful tool to have on hand just for general conversion purposes.

### 03Online File Converter

Online File Converter, as you can probably guess from the name, is an online conversion tool! This tool, much like Zamzar, is a heavy-hitter when it comes to conversion inputs and outputs compatibility. So, not only are you able to do the general **MP3 into MP4** conversion promised today, but you can do other things as well! Plus, no download or installation is required! All you need is an internet connection to access the website the converter is on and a little patience while you wait to upload, convert, and download the file in question.

### 04Any Conv

AnyConv is an alternate to the Online File Converter if you're looking for an online solution, but you don't like the interface of one or the other. The two are pretty much identical in terms of features. All you need to do in order to use it is to upload the file that you want to convert, choose a format, and then download the output file when you're done!

### 05Uniconverter

Uniconverter is an online **MP3 to MP4** tool from Wondershare (the same creators of Filmora Pro). It's a very solid tool. And it's quite a convenient one too. Since, just like any online converter, all you need to start using it is an internet connection.

### 06MConverter - Chrome Extension

Our last pick brings us back to unique solutions! Specifically, we're delving into the realm of Chrome extensions! This tool, the MConverter, works similarly to the other converters on this list. But, of course, in this case, if you want to use it in order to convert your files, you must first download the plug-in to your Chrome browser!

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** Despite the variety of options out there for **MP3 into MP4** converters, they all pretty much work the same. First, you upload the file that you want to convert. Second, you select the output format for the conversion. And finally, third, you finish the conversion!

**●** Most MP3 to MP4 converters work for other formats as well. For example, if you want to convert your **MP3 to MOV** instead — that's possible! OR, if you want to do the opposite, and convert **MP4 to MP3**, that works too!

**●** The difference between the different audio-to-video converters is usually the type of extra features it comes with as well as from what platform you can use it. For the latter, there are software types that you download and install to your computer, online types that you access through the internet, and extensions that you plug into your browser! Pick the one that works best with your workflow.

## Part 1 **Easy Steps on Convert MP3 into MP4**

For the first part of this article, we'll be covering how to use a **free** **MP3 to MP4 converter** in order to successfully change the format of your audio into a video file! There will be two examples given for this, one for the straightforward **MP3 into MP4** conversion the other for the more specified **MP3 to MOV** conversion!

### 01How to Convert MP3 to MP4?

**Step 1: Launch MP3 to MP4 Convert (for Windows)**

For our example, we'll be using the **free MP3 to MP4 converter**, EaseUS Video Converter! This is open-source software, so you can use it for free!

To start using your chosen **free MP3 to MP4 converter**, upload the file that you want to convert! For our example converter, it's as simple as dragging and dropping your chosen MP3 into the interface (as pointed out in the image below.)

![Launch MP3 to MP4 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%201.png)

**Step 2: Choose Output Format!**

Once the MP3 file has been uploaded, choose your desired output format.

(For our example **MP3 to MP4 converter**, this means selecting the settings icon for the file in question and then choosing a format from the pop-up window that appears (shown in the image below).

![Choose MP4 Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%202.png)

**Step 3: Start Converting!**

Once you've chosen your desired output format (which in this case is **MP3 into MP4**), select the "CONVERT" button to finish up!

![Convert MP3 into MP4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%203.png)

**Step 4: Save MP3 Into MP4**

Depending on your chosen **free MP3 to MP4 converter**, your new MP4 file may have to be downloaded manually or not.

In the case of EaseUS Video Converter, it is downloaded automatically, all you have to do is select the "Finished" tab and select "OPEN" to go directly to the file location.

![Open Finished MP4 File](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%204.png)

### 02How to Convert MP3 to MOV?

We've also included how you can convert **MP3 to MOV** with the same tool! As you will surely see, much of the process is the same. Only one step is really changed!

**Step 1: Uploaded MP3 File!**

First, just like in the previous section, upload your MP3 file (by dragging and dropping the file onto the **MP3 to MOV** converter.)

![Choose Files for Upload](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%205.png)

**Step 2: Select 'MOV' Format!**

This is the step where things change, of course! Now, rather than choosing MP4, you should select the "MOV" format for your output type! This will ensure that your MP3 file is converted specifically to a MOV file.

![Select MOV output format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%206.png)

![Select Conver or Convert All](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%207.png)

Then, finally, go to the "Finished" tab to find your new MOV file.
