**No 2\. VLC - Open-source Network Stream Player**

VLC media player must be the leader in the streaming player world. In addition to a RTSP player, VLC is also capable of analyzing and playing HTTP, RTP, MMS and HLS streams. For offline media streaming, VLC is similar to 5KPlayer to provide a DLNA function for multi-screen sharing. Besides, [VLC AirPlay](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) function is also under active development to Apple users. Speaking of local media files, VLC media player is also an ideal choice since it has a lot of tweaks and settings for users to customize.

**No 3\. FFmpeg - An Open-source Project Can Access RTSP Stream**

FFmpeg is not a media player, actually, it is a powerful, free and open-source project for handling video, audio, and other multimedia files and streams. Some of the core algorithms of VLC, YouTube, iTunes, etc. are based on the workflow of this program. It is fast to access RTSP, RTMP, HTTP, HLS, etc stream but it is very complex to set up and use.

**No 4\. Megacubo - A Free, Simple and Intuitive IPTV Player**

Megacubo is a dedicated streaming player which can automatically capture the content from transmission link/URL. In addition to RTSP, it can also [play M3U8](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/), RTMP, and IPTV playlist lists. But this player is only capable with Windows and Linux system.

**No 5\. Kodi - An Open-source Media Player for Windows/Mac**

Kodi is a free and open-source media player software application developed by the XBMC Foundation that can be used on Windows and macOS computer. The most important thing to make Kodi one of the best choices to play RTSP stream is that you can customize your own player (easier than VLC), not only including the skin of the player, but also the features. Besides, you can install different add-ons to make it as simple as a light-weight video player, or as powerful as a video toolbox.
