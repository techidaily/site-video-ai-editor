Text-to-Speech is an ingenious accessibility invention that has only grown more and more popular as AI has been thrown in the mix — making the converted speech sound more natural than ever!

As requested, in this article, we’ll be focusing on the subject of **converting text to MP3** format (or, rather, a tangible file that you can use for projects!)

#### In this article

01 [What is TTS?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Turn on Text to Speech Converter?](#Part 2)

03 [Useful Tips on Converting Text to MP3](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **What is TTS?**

What is Text-to-Speech? Text-to-Speech, also called TTS, as previously mentioned, is an accessibility invention. It was developed to help those with vision impairment or blindness — giving them the ability to have text read to them out loud to them (without requiring someone specifically read it out loud for them.

More recent development in TTS technology has allowed it to grow more useful outside of those parameters, however. Especially seeing as it is now possible to convert **text to MP3 with natural voices**.

### 01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?

**Text-to-Speech human voice converter**s are popular with content creators, and thus, they are the ones who see the most use for them (in the commercial sense). After all, it’s easy enough to convert already created content (in the form of text) into an audio file that there’s no reason not to! Especially since it means that more people would have access to their content!

### 02Benefits of Free Online Text to Speech Readers

The benefit of FREE online **text-to-speech human voice converter**s is exactly because they are free. Getting a live voice actor to **convert text to MP3** for you is very expensive — since you’re paying not only for the voice-actors hours spent but also the use of the expensive equipment that they use for creating voiceovers.

In that regard, even PAID text-to-speech converters are easier on the budget. Making it the perfect solution for content creators who want to increase the accessibility of their content but do not have the time (to create the voiceovers themselves) or the money (to hire someone else to record it).

### 03Features of Text to Mp3 Converter

There are lots of text-to-speech converters out there. And, depending on what you’re looking for, you might find yourself longing for extra features later on down the line. That is why, when looking to **convert text to MP3** we recommend considering the following:

**●** **Converting Time**: How fast does the converter work? Most text-to-speech converters work almost instantaneously! So, if the one you’re using currently is slow? It might be best to give it a pass over to the next candidate.

**●** **Sound Quality**: You should also test out whether or not the sound quality of the converted text to speech is good.

**●** **Multi-Language Support**: Since this is all for the sake of increasing accessibility, you should start thinking about how many languages your converter supports as well. You might not be able to use all of them or even want to. But, that extra function can be helpful for the future.

**●** **Voice-Control Options**: Does the converter offers you advanced voice controls? Your average converter usually offers speed and voice options, but you might find that a text-to-speech converter with more advanced options (i.e., tone, pitch, etc. controls) may help you get better quality content in the long run.

![Online Text-to-MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-3.png)

## Part 2 **How to Turn on Text to Speech Converter?**

For the next part of this article, we’ll be teaching you how to actually get **from text to speech (MP3)** with the use of a TTS converter. Specifically, a FREEmium text-to-speech converter that you can use when you’re still on the trying-out stage! This part will include a tutorial and a short introduction:

### 014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?

First, for the promised tutorial! Most **text-to-human voice converter**s function much the same way. The main difference usually being on the number of features focused and the limitations imposed (for tools with FREEmium services that impose limits on the FREE version, like the tool we’ll be using for our example):

**Step 1: Upload Text**

First, upload the text that you want to convert into speech!

Most online converters offer a text box that you can use in order to copy & paste the text onto (like in the image below), while others offer an ‘upload’ feature that you can use to upload text from a document.

![Upload or Copy & Paste Text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-4.png)

**Step 2: Adjust Voice Reader!**

Next, the main thing that you usually have to worry about is the voice options.

Most TTS converters at least offer the opportunity to choose what voice you want the text to be read in. Some, more advanced solutions, may offer voices in other languages, dialects, accents, etc. as well as voice control options (tone, pitch, etc.)

![Set Voice Reader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-5.png)

**Step 3: Reader Controls!**

Outside of voice options, most text-to-speech converters also offer the ability to control the general outcome of the converted text to speech.

More advanced tools will have multiple options on offer for this, but even the most basic ones at least offer a method for controlling the speed at which the text is read by the voice you’ve chosen!

![Adjust Speech Controls](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-6.png)

**Step 4: Convert Text to MP3!**

Now is finally the time to **convert text to MP3** format! Some TTS readers will not allow for this without you paying the premium price, but most will at least offer a limited MP3 conversion feature (usually one that limits the length of conversion or the quality).

![Convert Text to MP3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-7.png)

### 02What is the Best Free Text to Speech Software?

To finish off this section, we introduce the tool we used for our examples! It’s the online **text to human voice converter**, NaturalReader (URL has been provided below!) You can use this tool either directly or on your desktop (a software version is available.) It is FREEmium software though. That means that, if you want to make use of all of its advanced features, you’ll need to pay a price!

![NaturalReaders Landing Page](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-8.png)

## Part 3 **Useful Tips on Converting Text to MP3**

The tutorial in the previous section was really more for the sake of ensuring that you have the basics down and that you are familiar with how these text-to-speech converters usually work. In this next part, we’ll be focusing on “super tips”

OR, tips that allow you to generally make the most of these **text-to-human voice converters** to the fullest!

**Tip 1: Use AI Text-to-Speech!**

Our first tip is to encourage you to take full advantage of AI text-to-speech functions. Artificial Intelligence allows the converted text to sound much nicer and much more like it was read by an actual human being — which enables you to create a very professional-sounding project without having to hire a voiceover actor/actress.

![Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Text-to-Speech](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-9.png)

**Tip 2: Language and Regions Settings!**

If your content is available in multiple languages and you want to convert all of the different editions of said content, you’ll need to find a converter that supports all of those languages. You may also consider looking for regional support as well. For example, for basic English language, most TTS converters usually have “American” voices as well as “British” voices to support different accents despite them using the same text.

![Language and Regions Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-10.png)

**Tip 3: Pick an Appropriate Voice!**

The voice you choose to read your text is also very important. Some premium **text-to-human voice converters** offer a great variety to choose from to give you options when it comes to what kind of voice you want to read your content.

![TTS Voices Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-11.png)

**Tip 4: Audio Settings!**

This is a bit of a rare feature, but some TTS converters will allow you to adjust your audio before it converts your **content from text to speech (MP3)**. Sometimes, this is as simple as allowing you to choose an audio format (as is shown in the image below), other times, it allows you to control the actual sound quality of the finished product.

![TTS Audio Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-12.png)

**Tip 5: Adjust Voice Speed!**

Earlier, we emphasized the importance of choosing your voice reader carefully! Now, we focus on the subject of speed. Some voices are better when they are slowed down, others are better when sped up. Play around with these settings to see which way is more natural for your chosen voice!

![TTS Voice Speed Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-13.png)

**Tip 6: Adjust Voice Pitch**

To allow for even more flexibility when it comes to voice style, you’ll find that some TTS converters will allow you to adjust voice pitch! This is a helpful feature for when you’re looking for that particular voice type, as it will allow you to experiment more with the kind of sound you want your content to be known for.

![Voice Pitch Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-14.png)

**Tip 7: Voice Effects Options!**

Another advanced feature that you might run into (and should definitely take advantage of), is voice effects! This, again, will allow you to fully customize the type of voice that your content is known for. It’s also great for when you’re aiming for a more natural sound (if you’re patient enough in order to take full advantage of it!)

![Voice Effects Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-15.png)

**Tip 8: Use Advanced Video Editing!**

Our last tip is not on the subject of using a TTS converter itself, but on the tool, you use in order to create your final project! For that, we recommend **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**.

Filmora is a content creation tool that will allow you to expand your video editing capabilities with little to no effort. It’s highly intuitive and thus incredibly very easy to use — allowing you to create and perfect your content efficiently! It’s also, in this case, very good at ensuring that you can make full use of your carefully curated TTS MP3!

**Text-to-Speech human voice converter**s are popular with content creators, and thus, they are the ones who see the most use for them (in the commercial sense). After all, it’s easy enough to convert already created content (in the form of text) into an audio file that there’s no reason not to! Especially since it means that more people would have access to their content!

### 02Benefits of Free Online Text to Speech Readers

The benefit of FREE online **text-to-speech human voice converter**s is exactly because they are free. Getting a live voice actor to **convert text to MP3** for you is very expensive — since you’re paying not only for the voice-actors hours spent but also the use of the expensive equipment that they use for creating voiceovers.

In that regard, even PAID text-to-speech converters are easier on the budget. Making it the perfect solution for content creators who want to increase the accessibility of their content but do not have the time (to create the voiceovers themselves) or the money (to hire someone else to record it).

### 03Features of Text to Mp3 Converter

There are lots of text-to-speech converters out there. And, depending on what you’re looking for, you might find yourself longing for extra features later on down the line. That is why, when looking to **convert text to MP3** we recommend considering the following:

**●** **Converting Time**: How fast does the converter work? Most text-to-speech converters work almost instantaneously! So, if the one you’re using currently is slow? It might be best to give it a pass over to the next candidate.

**●** **Sound Quality**: You should also test out whether or not the sound quality of the converted text to speech is good.

**●** **Multi-Language Support**: Since this is all for the sake of increasing accessibility, you should start thinking about how many languages your converter supports as well. You might not be able to use all of them or even want to. But, that extra function can be helpful for the future.

**●** **Voice-Control Options**: Does the converter offers you advanced voice controls? Your average converter usually offers speed and voice options, but you might find that a text-to-speech converter with more advanced options (i.e., tone, pitch, etc. controls) may help you get better quality content in the long run.

![Online Text-to-MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-3.png)

## Part 2 **How to Turn on Text to Speech Converter?**

For the next part of this article, we’ll be teaching you how to actually get **from text to speech (MP3)** with the use of a TTS converter. Specifically, a FREEmium text-to-speech converter that you can use when you’re still on the trying-out stage! This part will include a tutorial and a short introduction:

### 014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?

First, for the promised tutorial! Most **text-to-human voice converter**s function much the same way. The main difference usually being on the number of features focused and the limitations imposed (for tools with FREEmium services that impose limits on the FREE version, like the tool we’ll be using for our example):

**Step 1: Upload Text**

First, upload the text that you want to convert into speech!

Most online converters offer a text box that you can use in order to copy & paste the text onto (like in the image below), while others offer an ‘upload’ feature that you can use to upload text from a document.

![Upload or Copy & Paste Text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-4.png)

**Step 2: Adjust Voice Reader!**

Next, the main thing that you usually have to worry about is the voice options.

Most TTS converters at least offer the opportunity to choose what voice you want the text to be read in. Some, more advanced solutions, may offer voices in other languages, dialects, accents, etc. as well as voice control options (tone, pitch, etc.)

![Set Voice Reader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-5.png)

**Step 3: Reader Controls!**

Outside of voice options, most text-to-speech converters also offer the ability to control the general outcome of the converted text to speech.

More advanced tools will have multiple options on offer for this, but even the most basic ones at least offer a method for controlling the speed at which the text is read by the voice you’ve chosen!

![Adjust Speech Controls](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-6.png)

**Step 4: Convert Text to MP3!**

Now is finally the time to **convert text to MP3** format! Some TTS readers will not allow for this without you paying the premium price, but most will at least offer a limited MP3 conversion feature (usually one that limits the length of conversion or the quality).

![Convert Text to MP3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-7.png)

### 02What is the Best Free Text to Speech Software?

To finish off this section, we introduce the tool we used for our examples! It’s the online **text to human voice converter**, NaturalReader (URL has been provided below!) You can use this tool either directly or on your desktop (a software version is available.) It is FREEmium software though. That means that, if you want to make use of all of its advanced features, you’ll need to pay a price!

## Part 3 **Useful Tips on Converting Text to MP3**

The tutorial in the previous section was really more for the sake of ensuring that you have the basics down and that you are familiar with how these text-to-speech converters usually work. In this next part, we’ll be focusing on “super tips”

OR, tips that allow you to generally make the most of these **text-to-human voice converters** to the fullest!

**Tip 1: Use AI Text-to-Speech!**

Our first tip is to encourage you to take full advantage of AI text-to-speech functions. Artificial Intelligence allows the converted text to sound much nicer and much more like it was read by an actual human being — which enables you to create a very professional-sounding project without having to hire a voiceover actor/actress.

![Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Text-to-Speech](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-9.png)

**Tip 2: Language and Regions Settings!**

If your content is available in multiple languages and you want to convert all of the different editions of said content, you’ll need to find a converter that supports all of those languages. You may also consider looking for regional support as well. For example, for basic English language, most TTS converters usually have “American” voices as well as “British” voices to support different accents despite them using the same text.

![Language and Regions Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-10.png)

**Tip 3: Pick an Appropriate Voice!**

The voice you choose to read your text is also very important. Some premium **text-to-human voice converters** offer a great variety to choose from to give you options when it comes to what kind of voice you want to read your content.

![TTS Voices Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-11.png)

**Tip 4: Audio Settings!**

This is a bit of a rare feature, but some TTS converters will allow you to adjust your audio before it converts your **content from text to speech (MP3)**. Sometimes, this is as simple as allowing you to choose an audio format (as is shown in the image below), other times, it allows you to control the actual sound quality of the finished product.

![TTS Audio Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-12.png)

**Tip 5: Adjust Voice Speed!**

Earlier, we emphasized the importance of choosing your voice reader carefully! Now, we focus on the subject of speed. Some voices are better when they are slowed down, others are better when sped up. Play around with these settings to see which way is more natural for your chosen voice!

![TTS Voice Speed Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-13.png)

**Tip 6: Adjust Voice Pitch**

To allow for even more flexibility when it comes to voice style, you’ll find that some TTS converters will allow you to adjust voice pitch! This is a helpful feature for when you’re looking for that particular voice type, as it will allow you to experiment more with the kind of sound you want your content to be known for.

![Voice Pitch Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-14.png)

**Tip 7: Voice Effects Options!**

Another advanced feature that you might run into (and should definitely take advantage of), is voice effects! This, again, will allow you to fully customize the type of voice that your content is known for. It’s also great for when you’re aiming for a more natural sound (if you’re patient enough in order to take full advantage of it!)

![Voice Effects Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-15.png)

**Tip 8: Use Advanced Video Editing!**

Our last tip is not on the subject of using a TTS converter itself, but on the tool, you use in order to create your final project! For that, we recommend **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**.

Filmora is a content creation tool that will allow you to expand your video editing capabilities with little to no effort. It’s highly intuitive and thus incredibly very easy to use — allowing you to create and perfect your content efficiently! It’s also, in this case, very good at ensuring that you can make full use of your carefully curated TTS MP3!

## Part 1 **What is TTS?**

What is Text-to-Speech? Text-to-Speech, also called TTS, as previously mentioned, is an accessibility invention. It was developed to help those with vision impairment or blindness — giving them the ability to have text read to them out loud to them (without requiring someone specifically read it out loud for them.

More recent development in TTS technology has allowed it to grow more useful outside of those parameters, however. Especially seeing as it is now possible to convert **text to MP3 with natural voices**.

## How to edit audio on FCP

There are 2 ways of editing audio of videos on FCP-clip-level audio editing and advanced audio editing.

#### Section 1 Clip-level audio editing

While dragging the audio or video clip onto the timeline you have surely seen the level line right above the clip waveform. One can just drag the level line and move it up or down for adjusting the dB of any given clip.

![Clip-level audio editing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-audio-in-fcp-1.png)

The job of the tiny white points on the right and left side of the clip is to apply the fade in and fade out effect on the audio. The left sided point can be dragged to the right to mark the ending of the fade-in effect of the clip. The right point has to be dragged left to set the start of the fade-out point.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-audio-in-fcp-2.png)

**Related Article:** [How to fade in/out audio in Final Cut Pro >>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Note:** In this level, any effects and adjustments in audio are applicable for the entire clip including the audio channels within it. All the adjustments in the individual audio channels made by you would be preserved by FCP. This implies that when one reduces the volume for just one channel but increases the volume of the entire clip, then the single channel’s volume is only raised in proportion to the volume of the other channels. Ideally, you should do your edits at the clip-level when you have only one or two audio channels on your video clip.

#### Section 2: Advanced Audio Editing

The audio of the video can be detached for editing the audio file separately. The Audio Inspector of FCP provides you with all precise controls of audio edit like pan, effect, volume, equalization and audio configuration.

![The Audio Inspector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-audio-in-fcp-3.png)

In order to detach the audio, you need to go to **Clip** \> **Detach Audio**. Or you can just right-click on the video file and click on Detach audio.

![Detach audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-audio-in-fcp-4.png)

**Note:** There is a fine difference between ‘Detach Audio’ and ‘Expand Audio’. In Expand Audio, the audio clip is synced with the video. For instance, while moving the audio to the timeline, the video clip would also go with it. In case of detaching audio however the audio file would remain as a standalone clip that can be inserted into any portion of the video.

The Audio Inspector would allow you to apply the following effects:

* The volume can be increased by dragging the handle on the right side and lowered by dragging it towards the left.
* Audio Equalization would allow the user to apply various effects (bass, loudness, boost, etc.) on the audio clip. It can also be adjusted by using the in-built audio equalizer.

![Audio Equalization](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-audio-in-fcp-5.png)

* Pan- Users can select from a number of Pan modes like surround sound or stereo. When you select ‘surround’, Final Cut Pro would provide you with a **Surround Panner** which would allow you to fine-tune the effects by moving the white point.

![Pan](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-audio-in-fcp-6.png)

* Effects- for this option one needs to go to the effects browser of the **Audio Inspector** or just hit comd5\. This would allow you to choose many different audio effects such as echo, distortion, spaces and much more. Just double-click on any effect to find a range of editing options.

![Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-audio-in-fcp-7.png)

* Audio Configuration: The audio configuration tool would allow the user to modify the audio channel with mono, stereo, or reverse stereo.

## How to edit audio on FCP

There are 2 ways of editing audio of videos on FCP-clip-level audio editing and advanced audio editing.

#### Section 1 Clip-level audio editing

While dragging the audio or video clip onto the timeline you have surely seen the level line right above the clip waveform. One can just drag the level line and move it up or down for adjusting the dB of any given clip.

![Clip-level audio editing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-audio-in-fcp-1.png)

The job of the tiny white points on the right and left side of the clip is to apply the fade in and fade out effect on the audio. The left sided point can be dragged to the right to mark the ending of the fade-in effect of the clip. The right point has to be dragged left to set the start of the fade-out point.

Developed by Lightricks Studio, Videoleap is one of the most powerful video editors, which is available for iOS and Android devices.

As I have listed above, **Videoleap for MacBook** is not directly available as it runs on iOS and Android devices only. Though, you can access this video editor on your Mac by using any reliable Android emulator tool. An emulator can load an Android OS environment on your Windows or Mac system, letting you run all these smartphone apps.

While there are plenty of Android emulators out there, these are some of the most popular options:

* BlueStacks
* Nox Player
* MEmu Player
* ARChon Player

Out of them, let’s consider the example of BlueStacks as it is the most popular and reliable Android emulator in the market. You can install BlueStacks on your MacBook for free, log in to your Google account, and can readily use Videoleap on it.

**Step 1: Install a Reliable Android Emulator like BlueStacks**

To begin with, you can install any reliable Android emulator on your MacBook. For instance, if you want to install BlueStacks, then you can visit its official website, and click on the “Download” button.

![download bluestacks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/videoleap-for-macbook-2.jpg)

Now, you can just click on the installer to run it on your MacBook. You can just go through a simple click-through process and select a location where you want to install the application on your Mac.

Just make sure that you have at least 5GB of available storage of your Mac (and it should have at least 2GB RAM).

![download bluestacks on Mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/videoleap-for-macbook-3.jpg)

**Step 2: Connect your Google Account on BlueStacks**

Once you have installed BlueStacks on your MacBook, you can launch it, and go to the Google Play app. From here, you can just log in to an active Google account on the BlueStacks app.

![Install Videoleap](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/videoleap-for-macbook-5.jpg)

After Videoleap is installed on BlueStacks, you can launch it, and start editing your videos without any hassle.

## Part 3: 2 Best Alternatives to Videoleap for MacBook

As you can see, installing **Videoleap for a MacBook** can be a tedious job as it is only available for smartphones. Therefore, instead of using an emulator to install Videoleap, you can consider using the following video editors on your Mac.

### 1\. Filmora

Filmora is one of the best video editing apps that is super-easy to use and fully supports all the major macOS versions. It is a multi-timeline [macOS video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that would let you apply all kinds of edits and use tons of visual effects to make your content look appealing.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

* _User-friendly Video Editing_

You can load clips, images, audio files, and other media content on different timelines of the editor. It provides instant solutions to crop, trim, rotate, flip, and do all the other edits in a user-friendly way.

* _AI-Integrated Features_

Wondershare Filmora has also included highly advanced Artificial Intelligence and Augmented Reality features. For instance, with its AI Portrait Mode, you can detect a human face on the video and instantly remove its background. There are also tons of AR stickers that you can just drag and drop to your videos.

* _Tons of Video Effects_

On Filmora, you can also explore hundreds of video transitions, overlays, filters, stickers, and numerous other effects. You can readily add captions and other text effects to your videos as well.

* _Sound Effects_

Apart from video editing, you can also edit the added soundtracks in your videos. Using Filmora, you can add voiceovers to your videos and apply effects like fade in/out, denoise, audio ducking, and so on.

* _Other Features_

Furthermore, Filmora offers some of the most advanced video editing effects for Mac such as Auto Reframe, color tuning, pan-and-zoom, green screen, video stabilization, and so much more.

### 2\. iMovie

Lastly, if you are looking for a freely available alternative for **Videoleap for MacBook**, then you can try iMovie. The video editor is developed by Apple and is already installed in leading Mac systems. While it doesn’t offer so many extensive features, iMovie would meet your basic video editing needs.

![iMovie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/videoleap-for-macbook-7.jpg)

* _Ready-made Templates_

On iMovie, you can find several professionally made templates that you can simply load and customize to create videos.

* _Sound Effects_

Besides editing your videos, you can also add sound effects to your projects, and edit them as per your preferences.

* _All Basic Editing Features_

Once the video is loaded on its timeline, iMovie will let you perform all the basic edits such as clip, trim, crop, rotate, flip, and so on.

* _Other Features_

A few advanced features of iMovie are green screen edits, tons of transitions and filters, 4K video editing, caption effects, and other optimized features for Mac.

## Final Words

There you go! I’m sure that after following this guide, you can easily use **Videoleap for MacBook.** Since Videoleap is only available for iOS and Android devices, I have come up with a stepwise approach to install it on Mac. Though, instead of Videoleap, you can consider using Wondershare Filmora on your MacBook. It is a far better and more user-friendly video editor for Mac that has some of the most advanced features.

## Part 3: 2 Best Alternatives to Videoleap for MacBook

As you can see, installing **Videoleap for a MacBook** can be a tedious job as it is only available for smartphones. Therefore, instead of using an emulator to install Videoleap, you can consider using the following video editors on your Mac.

### 1\. Filmora

It is a multi-timeline [macOS video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that would let you apply all kinds of edits and use tons of visual effects to make your content look appealing.

### 2\. iMovie

Lastly, if you are looking for a freely available alternative for **Videoleap for MacBook**, then you can try iMovie.

Though, instead of Videoleap, you can consider using Wondershare Filmora on your MacBook. It is a far better and more user-friendly video editor for Mac that has some of the most advanced features.
