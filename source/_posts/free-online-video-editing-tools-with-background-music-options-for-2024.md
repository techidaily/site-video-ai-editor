## Part 2: Top 3  Studio for Mac Alternatives

### 1\. Final Cut Pro

Final Cut Pro is a professional video editing software from Apple for anybody looking for a more powerful video editor for their Macs than the included iMovie. The software is also an excellent alternative for professionals creating content for TV and cinema. The latest version runs natively on M1 chip; you can expect apparent video editing improvements.

New features include transcoding media files automatically when copying or consolidating projects and downloadable user guides. Other highlighted recent features include Smart Conform, stabilization for 360-degree videos, performance improvements with RED and Canon RAW files, Inspector panel improvements, and audio crossfades.

**Price:** $299 (onetime payment, no subscription)

**Pros:**

* Fast and superb performance
* Works perfectly with Apple computers
* 360-degree video and HDR Support
* Multicam support

**Cons:**

* Lacks motion tracking and stabilization for 360-degree videos
* Integration with Adobe software seems problematic

### 2\. Lightworks

Another free video editing software that works as a good replacement for pinnacle studio for Mac is Lightworks. It's packed with many useful features, and although there is paid version, the free version has all the bells and whistles needed for beginners.

However, if you're working with 4K videos for YouTube or Vimeo—you need to get the paid version of Lightworks as this feature isn't available in the free version. The paid version costs $25 a month. The free version includes multi-cam support, high-precision video trimming, video exports at 720p, and support for most video formats.

![Lightworks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pinnacle-studio-for-mac-3.jpg)

**Price:** $25/month

**Pros:**

* Has many video tutorials
* Intuitive interface and easy to use
* The free version is ideal for beginners

**Cons:**

* No 4K video support in the free version
* Lacks predefined filters and effects

### 3\. OpenShot

With easy-to-use features, a simple interface, and real-time previews for transitions between clips, unlimited layers, and audio mixing capabilities, OpenShot is one of the top free video editing software around. One of the best things about OpenShot is that its interface allows for easy-to-use drag and drop features. If you're a Mac user and looking for a free, open-source video editor that packs more features than iMovie—OpenShot is a great alternative you can't miss.

With OpenShot's special effects engine, users can modify, reverse, slow up or slow down videos, and preview projects in real-time. Furthermore, other standard features of OpenShot include composition, image overlays, clip resizing, trimming, snapping, scaling, watermarks, video transitions, title templates, creating personalized SVG vector titles, desktop integration, adjusting fonts, colors, 3D animated titles, and more.

![Lightworks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pinnacle-studio-for-mac-4.jpg)

**Price:** Free, Open Source

**Pros:**

* Ideal for beginners
* Unlimited layers
* Professional transitions and effects
* Runs on entry-levels hardware

**Cons**

* Exporting videos isn't the fastest

* [**Part 1: Film Editing Software to Edit Videos**](#part1)
* [**Part 2: Filmmaking Software to Improve Workflow**](#part2)

## 6 Filmmaking Software You Need to Know

## Part 1: Film Editing Software to Edit Videos

### 1. [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### 2. [Vegas Pro](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/vegas-pro/)

Vegas Pro is one of the most well-known budget options out there when it comes to video editing. It actually started out as editing software for audio (podcasts, radio shows, etc.), but then expanded over time. Because of those beginnings, many people have found that it is one of the best options you’ll have available when it comes to audio editing within a film. It’s also very versatile – you don’t need anything but a Windows PC in order to run it.

![Vegas Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/magix-vegas-pro.jpg)

## Part 2: Filmmaking Software to Improve Workflow

### 2. [StudioBinder](https://www.studiobinder.com/script-sides/)

Keeping up with the production process takes a lot of work, and Studio Binder was specially designed to help you take care of those things more easily. From script breakdowns (which keep everyone in the loop as to what is next in filming) to lists where you keep track of what shots you’ve taken and which you need to take, it has everything you need to keep your entire team on track throughout the entire process of filming.

![StudioBinder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/StudioBinder.jpg)

### 3. [Storyboarder](https://wonderunit.com/storyboarder/)

Keeping up with the story and everything around it during the filming process can take a lot of work. That’s why many filmmakers suggest putting together what is known as a storyboard – a rough draft of the storyline, put together in a fashion so that you can follow everything and check it all out properly. Storyboarder is a software package that helps you to visualize everything, check out if the story works, and keep up with your ideas (even if you get distracted during filming).

![Storyboarder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/Storyboarder.jpg)

### 4. [Adobe Audition](https://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html)

Sometimes, you need something that is a little more advanced and focused when it comes to putting together the sound mix in a way that is pleasing to the ears. Adobe Audition is one of the most popular options for this, because it has all of the tools necessary so that you can get the perfect balance and fullness of sound in your film. Your sound is just as important as your videography, so picking this up can be really helpful in the long run.

![Adobe Audition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audition.jpg)

### 5. [Evernote](https://evernote.com/)

Organization is absolutely essential when you’re trying to put a film together and, because of that, you’re likely exploring a lot of different options that can help you to stay organized. Evernote is a lovely option and it’s available for computers and for phones/tablets, so you can take it anywhere with you. You can put together task lists, keep notes on what’s going on during the filming process, and more. It’s a really simple program to use and it’s quite easy to import and export info from it.

![Evernote](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/Evernote.jpg)

### 6. [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/)

Google Docs is part of the Google Suite, and it’s a smart word processing program that has all of the flexibility of programs like Microsoft Word. One of the biggest differences, however, is the ability to collaborate and work on the same document without the need to send it back and forth via email. Changes are updated in real time, so you can work on a document together, even if you aren’t in the same vicinity.

![Google Docs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/Google-Docs.jpg)

## Conclusion

Do some research on the web and find the options that work best for your team’s budget and for how you plan on working on your films. You can find plenty of low-budget software that can help to make your film look great without breaking the budget you’ve set into place.

#### In this article

01 [Benefits of Square and Vertical Videos](#Part 1)

02 [How Vertical Videos Are Displayed](#Part 2)

03 [What's the Best Tip to Resize Social Media Vertical Video Ratio?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 Benefits of Square and Vertical Videos

**●**   **What is Square Video & Vertical Video?**

A Square Video is the one that has the same width and height while a vertical video is taller than it is wide. A vertical video or a square video is presented in the form of a landscape. A square video has an aspect ratio of 1:1 while a vertical video has an aspect ratio of 9:16.So, in a vertical video, the **horizontal video size** is less than its vertical size.

**●**   **Why Vertical Video is Dominating**

It would not be wrong to say that the world has taken a mobile route and with this, the dominance of vertical videos can be seen. As per the studies it has been found that around 75% of the video playback across the globe are from mobile phones and around 94% of the time, the phones are held vertically. These figures completely state the need for the hour-vertical videos.

With users holding their mobile phones vertically the majority of the time, the dominance of the vertical videos is no surprise.

**●**   **Benefits of Square and Vertical Videos**

There are several benefits of having square and vertical videos. These videos are specifically

designed for mobile phones and thus they can be easily posted on multiple social media sites without any need for change or editing. Other benefits of using vertical videos are their ease of recording through a mobile phone. Vertical videos are beneficial even for the advertisers and promoters as they help them reach more audiences and prospective customers through social media sites and other sites.

## Part 2 How Vertical Videos Are Displayed

Vertical videos are majorly displayed on mobile devices as smartphones are used vertically most of the time. The width of these videos is less as compared to their height and this makes them appear fit on the smartphone’s screen. Moreover, using the s**creen aspect ratio calculator**, you can further decide upon the aspect ratio depending on the size of the device screen on which video has to be played.

## Part 3 What's the Best Tip to Resize social media Vertical Video Ratio?

Listed below are the tips for resizing the social media vertical video ratio.

**●** **Learn about the Aspect Ratios**

A vertical video is taller than it is wide. Thus, any video that is taller than the 1:1 aspect ratio will be termed a vertical video. The commonly used aspect ratio is 9:16 that uses the complete vertical screen. So, to capture a vertical video, use the camera in portrait mode or edit it as per the vertical aspect ratio. There are also **TV aspect ratio calculator** tools that can be used for the task.

![Learn About Aspect Ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/resize-vertical-video-for-social-media-2.jpg)
