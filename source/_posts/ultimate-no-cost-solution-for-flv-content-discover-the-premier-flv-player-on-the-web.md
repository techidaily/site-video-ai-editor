Having trouble playing your locally-stored flash videos by using normal flash video player, like video and audio out of sync, video stuttering or even FLV not playing at all? Or looking for a certain flash video player to playback the flash videos from the sharing sites like YouTube, Vimeo, Vevo, etc? Don't vex. You just need to switch to the all-conquering FLV video player named **[5KPlayer](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/)**, perfectly compatible with Mac and Windows10/8/7, that plays all the flash videos in any resolution including smoothly in full screen without annoying FLV video conversion process required.
