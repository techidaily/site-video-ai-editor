In fact, because of the transition to 64-bit technology in macOS in 2019, you will see an alert when using iMovie about the media files that won't be compatible with macOS Catalina. For sure, the incompatible video format includes AV1\. As of now, you can only solve can't play AV1 on Mac problem through converting AV1 to Mac compatible format like HEVC, H.264, MP4, etc if you want to play AV1 videos with the native Mac media player like QuickTime.

### **AV1 Playback Issue with VLC**

_"VLC won't play av1\. The decoder seems to be struggling on higher bitrates. I don't think using the nightly build made a lot of difference."_ 
 _"Trying to play Aomedia AV1 video codec in WebM container. VLC 3.0.3 can't really figure out the codec, and fails. While v4.x nightly shows black screen, i.e. cannot decode the video."_

Even the quite new VLC 3.0.8 can't play AV1 video files though [VLC AV1](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/) support has been added for a long time, some users said. When playing AV1 with the well-known and versatile VLC media player, sometimes it totally can't play, sometimes the sound plays but no image appears.

**Solution:** Upgrade your VLC media player to the latest version 3.0.10 to see if it works. Or manually set the configuration to the right situation by unchecking the "Use hardware YUV -> RGB conversions" checkbox or set the Output to DirectX, Direct3D, Windows GDI or OpenGL. Or just switch to professional AV1 video player 5KPlayer.
