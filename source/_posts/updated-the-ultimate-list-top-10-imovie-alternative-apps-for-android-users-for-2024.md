It is because a perfect size requirement makes the videos more professional and engaging. On Instagram, size requirements are not limited to the dimensions only there are many other aspects that make a video on Instagram have a high quality and worth sharing. These may include the **Instagram video aspect ratio** and file size too.

### 01What is the largest file size allowed on Instagram?

### 02Are 1920 x 1080 files ok on Instagram?

Nowadays,the most suitable file size on Instagram is 1920\*1080 PX. This is because this size goes well on Instagram stories, reels, IGTV videos, live videos, etc. As per the increased demand, the quality of the videos has also been improved.

### 03The ideal ratio and resolution for Instagram posts

The ideal ratio for Instagram posts is 9:16 and the best resolution is 1080\*1920 PX.

**\***With the correct video settings one can flawlessly post his videos for his followers. Here mentioned are some types of video post that can show you the ideal aspect ratio and best resolution for Instagram:

**❶ Instagram reels**

**●** **Description:** Reels are seen vertically on the mobile phones. Also these are shot using the Instagram application only so you can take the advantage of transitions and effects present within the application to create your reels effectively. The maximum length for Instagram reels must be 60 seconds. Usually the bottom part of these reel videos is for captions and descriptions, so there should be no important information at that place.

**●** **Ideal Aspect Ratio:** The ideal aspect ratio for Instagram reels is 9:16.

**●** **Best Resolution:** For Instagram reels; best recommended resolution is 1080\*1920 PX.

People love to scroll their Instagram feeds and this is the reason why feed videos are getting popular day by day. Instagram feed supports so many sizes and dimensions of the videos.
