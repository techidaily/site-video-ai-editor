Today, when we have hard drives and multi-terabytes, many of us have stopped looking at the disk space. Many of you usually don't bother until you get an alert that the disk is full.

Sometimes the largest drives get filled eventually. If you haven't checked your disk space yet, use your Mac and follow the instructions given below. You may be surprised about how much space can FCPX take.

Here is how you will do it:

**Option 1: Checking the mac storage through "About this Mac"**

Now it is a bit easy to check the storage from about the section. You will find this in most of the recent MAC versions.

Click on the mac logo and then click on “About this mac”.

Click on “storage” and you will see a reference chart stacked portraying the capacity of the disk and the absolute amount of storage taken by different categories of information. Moreover, you will find out the space that is yet accessible to you.

 **Option 2: Checking the mac storage through “Disk utility”**

If you're a Mac user, you might know that there is a disk utility app. You can easily get a readout of the available space from there.
