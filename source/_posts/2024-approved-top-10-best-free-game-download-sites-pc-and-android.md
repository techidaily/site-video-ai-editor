 **Edit and enhance audio**

If you want to add an additional audio file as the background music to the videos and photos, just drag your favorite audio clip to the music track. To further edit the audio file, just double click the clip. Then the Audio Inspector will pop up for you to adjust different settings like pitch, volume, and speed or add Fade in/out effect. You can also right click the audio to cut, copy or trim the audio file.
