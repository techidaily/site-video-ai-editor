It will also be available on LG, Sony, Vizio smart TVs, as well as the popular Roku and Amazon Fire TV. However, there is no Apple TV app for Chromebooks, Windows and Android-based devices, but you can still access the shows through tv.apple.com websites with Safari, Chrome and Firefox on these platforms.

Disney plus will allow for video streaming via the web browser on PCs, and through an app on Apple iOS iPhone iPad and Apple TV, Android mobile devices, Android TV, Chromecast, Roku devices, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. However, it won't support Amazon devices like Amazon Fire TV when it is launched. On top of that, contents available on Disney+ will also be listed in the Apple TV app.

**Netflix vs Apple TV Plus vs Disney Plus: More to Know**

Based on a study by Streaming Observer compared various streaming content libraries using Rotten Tomatoes scores and found that Netflix has more Certified Fresh movies than Amazon Prime, Hulu, and HBO combined. So as of 2019, Netflix is still the biggest and best video streaming service that you should choose.

But without doubt, Apple TV Plus will be a big competitor to Netflix. Besides, what we have mentioned above, Apple TV+ will also support 4K HDR and Dolby Atmos. If you want to watch the shows offline, you can choose to download them. Within the Apple TV app, you can buy, rent and watch the purchased iTunes contents as well. Audiences worldwide can enjoy Apple TV+ originals subtitled and/or dubbed in nearly 40 languages, including Subtitles for the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (SDH) or closed captions. Apple TV+ series and movies will also be available with audio descriptions in eight languages.

Disney Plus also supports HDR and 4K Ultra HD in Dolby Vision, HDR10 and Dolby Atmos immersive audio. Unlimited mobile downloads for offline viewing is another great feature that you can download contents to up to 10 mobile or tablets devices. For users from different regions, this video streaming service will support English, Spanish, French and Dutch languages at launch in both user interface and audio support and subtitles for library contents. If you want to enjoy Disney+ shows with your families, you can create seven user profiles for different members of the household. But different from Netflix's new movie releasing when it staring airing, Disney will offer the resource after the appearance in cinema.
