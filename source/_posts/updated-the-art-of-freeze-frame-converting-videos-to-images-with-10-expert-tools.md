If a video is recorded at the standard [frame rate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), each second of that video will contain 24 individual images or frames. Nearly all [modern video editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) products grant you access to each frame a video clip contains, which can be quite useful if you want to create a quick preview of the footage you are editing.

Even though **converting a video to a photo** is not something you can do, creating JPEG on PNG image files from the video you recorded with a smartphone or a [professional video camera](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) takes only a few moments of your time. Read on if you would like to learn [how to extract still images from video clips](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) in desktop-based and online video converters.

## Part 1: Converting Videos to JPEG and PNG Images with Desktop Video Converters for macOS and Windows

Exporting a single frame of a video clip is an easy task even amateur photo and video editors can perform effortlessly. Mac and PC users have a broad range of options at their disposal if they want to make still images from their videos. Let’s have a look at some of the best video converters you can use to capture still frames and create JPEG or PNG files.

### 1\. Wondershare Filmora

Filmora is a video editing software that also offers the option to capture frames of all video clips you use in your projects after you launch the Filmora video editor, import a video file that contains the frames you would like to save as still images.

To extract still images with the original high quality, you can import and place these videos to Project Media and then double-click it to preview. In the preview window, click the Camera icon located in the lower right corner to take a snapshot. It is worth noting that you can only create PNG files with this video editing software, and you may need to change the photo format if PNG isn’t your choice.

![Extract PNG Image from Filmora9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/take-snapchat-9.jpg)

Alternatively, you can use the CTRL+ALT+S keyboard shortcut to take a snapshot of the frame in a video clip. The image you created will be added to the Media tab automatically, and you can proceed to right-click on it and select the Reveal in Explorer option to gain access to the original file.

To extract still image from the video frame by frame, you can add the media asset to the timeline and use the playhead to find the frame you would like to extract from the video. When done, leave the playhead at the location on the timeline where the frame is located, and then click on the Snapshot icon.

### 2\. Adobe Photoshop

This is arguably the best photo editing software ever created that grants you access to all the tools you need to manipulate pictures as you see fit. Adobe Photoshop also enables its users to edit videos, although in a limited capacity. In order to turn a video into a series of separate frames, you just have to import a video file into Adobe Photoshop by clicking on the file menu and selecting the Import option.

![Convert Video to Image in Photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/convert-video-to-image-with-adobe-photoshop.jpg)

The video clip is going to be displayed on the timeline that is located at the bottom of the screen and you just have to specify the segment of that file you would like to break down into frames. You can do this by dragging the handles located above the video clip that allows you to set the start and end of the work area.

![Render Video to convert to Images in PS](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-video-to-images-photoshop.jpg)

When done, head over to the File menu, and select the Render Video option from the Export submenu. After the Render Video window pops up on the screen, you have to change the Adobe Media Encoder option to Photoshop Image Sequence and then click on the Render button. You should keep in mind that the photo editor is going to create separate image files for all the frames that were within the work area you defined, which is why it is important to reduce the work area to the minimum in order to avoid generating hundreds of JPEG images.

### 3\. VLC Media Player

Extracting still frames with VLC media players is a technical process that will require some understanding of the video editing process. Even so, you can still use this open-source software to generate PNG or JPEG files from your videos.

![Convert video to image Preferences  in VCL](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vcl-convert-video-to-image-preference.jpg)

Select the Preferences option from the Tools menu and then click on the Video tab. Make sure that the All option is selected under Show Settings and scroll down until you find the Filters option and expand this menu. Locate the Scene Filter, click on it and then proceed to specify the format in which your images are going to be saved and adjust the Recording Ratio.

Click on the Save button to confirm the changes, then go back to the Filter submenu, and this time you should click on it rather than expand it. Locate the Scene Video filter, make sure that the checkbox next to it is selected, and click OK to complete the process.
