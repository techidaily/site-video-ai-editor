**Price:** Free

![ best music video maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/videofx-music-video-maker.jpg)

Making lip-sync videos with this app is easy, but you must use your own music since the Video FX Music Video Maker doesn't offer royalty free music library. You can either use an MP3 file or record your own voice to make the soundtrack for the video. The app offers advanced video recording options, so you can pause and resume shooting at any moment or use the Start Timer option to give yourself time to prepare before the recording starts. The newly added Stop Motion feature enables you to animate your music videos, while the Fast Motion recording mode allows you to speed up all movement in the video.

The app's music collection includes some of the most popular songs at the moment, so you can even participate in different music challenges or create lip-sync videos with music from your favorite singers. Triller lets you draw over videos, apply different visual effects or add text overlays, but some of these features must be purchased, as the free version of the app offers only a limited amount of ways to edit music and video.
