[Tips for Recording Time Lapse Video on iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## Method 1: Creating time lapse video from photos

#### 1  Import the original photos to Filmora

After installing and launch Filmora video editor, import the shot time lapse photos to it. Click **New Project** and then click the **Import** button to add your photos to the media library. You can also directly drag and drop your video to the program. Then all the imported files will appear as thumbnails in the left of the window.

![text overlay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-video-9.jpg)

You can also import the photos from the video shooting device. Just plug in the video camera, click **Import from Phone or Camera** option in Import menu, and then transfer the target media files to Filmora.

After that, you need to select and drag and drop all the photos to the first video track.

#### 2 Preview the photos

After all your photos are placed in timeline, you can zoom in the timeline or preview it in the Preview window to check if it needs any order adjustment or deletion.

#### 3 Adjust Photo Duration to Create Time lapse Video

Select one of the photos in the timeline and right click on it to select **Speed and Duration** to open the Custom Speed panel. Go to **Duration** section, and change the duration of the photo to 00:00:00:01 or other duration based on your needs, and then click **OK**.

![ Photo Timelapse video ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/custom-speed-panel.jpg)

You can also add a background music to make time lapse more professional. You can choose a music sound from the built-in music library or import your own audio file.

#### 4 Export your new video

Place the timeline playhead at the beginner, and play it in Preview window to check the time lapse effects. If everything works fine, click the **Export** tab and choose the target format and click **SETTINGS** to output the time lapse video. Here you can change the video format and video and audio parameters such as Bit Rate, Encoder, Resolution and so on.

## Method 2: Speed Up to Make a Time lapse Video

In case that you want to make a time lapse video with video footage, below are the step-by-step tutorial:

#### 1 Import Video Footage

Just like importing photos to Filmora, follow the steps to import the video clips to media library.

#### 2 Cut out part of the video for time lapse editing (optional)

Next, drag your video onto the video column in the timeline. Select the loaded video and click the "Play" button. While playing the video, drag the slider bar at the start time and hit the "Split" icon to cut out the part you want to do time lapse editing.

#### 3 Speed up to create time lapse video

Right click on the video clip in the timeline to select **Speed and Duration**. Then a window will pop up for you to adjust the settings of video. Find the **Speed** option and drag the slider bar to the right to increase the speed. If you set the playback speed to play at 200% the original speed, then the 30-second clip be only 15 seconds (twice the speed). After that click **OK**. Click the **Play** button to preview the result. Filmora now support up to 100x fast mo and 0.01x slow mo.
