_Is there a way to trim VLC without losing quality?_ Of course! Trimming VLC videos without losing quality can be a bit frustrating sometimes. Fortunately, there are applications available that can help you edit videos without losing quality. Wondershare Filmora is one such software that can be downloaded for free. You cannot miss it.

In this article, we will introduce why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality, then recommend 3 video editors trim high-quality video without lowering the quality.

* [Section 1\. Why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality](#why-trim-vlc-loss-quality)
* [Section 2\. Video editor to trim VLC videos without loss of quality](#software-trim-vlc-without-loss-quality)

## Section 1.  Why trimming VLC videos will result in loss of quality?

To understand quality loss, you first need to understand codecs, containers, and video re-encoding. This might get a little technical, so keep sipping that coffee!

#### 1\. Codec

Every video has a codec and a container associated with it. A video codec is an order in which the video data is organized for playback, editing, and other functions. There are lots of different types of codecs, and each of them has different functions and advantages.

#### 2\. Container

A container is responsible for holding video data and other information in a single file. Containers have file extensions like .mp4, .avi, .mov, etc. Some containers can only hold videos in one specific codec, while others can hold multiple codecs. Containers are also responsible for telling media players whether a video has audio or not.

Why are codecs and containers so important? Imagine if you watched a 1080p video (codec) on an old TV (container) – it would work, but would you really be interested in seeing it? Probably not. A mismatch between containers and codecs can result in poor quality, which is why you must shoot your videos in the right format and play them on the right platform.

#### 3\. Video compression and re-encoding

You might be wondering at what point of the whole process does the video loses quality. When you capture the video, it is of the highest quality. As soon as you compress it to share it online, some quality loss occurs, even if you convert it into a high-quality video.

When you export a video that’s already been exported, you re-encode the video. **Re-encoding a VLC video can result in even more quality loss.**

The truth is, you can’t reduce the video size without losing quality no matter what you do. If you’re editing a video shot in 4K, but you export it in 720p, the video will become compressed, and the original data of the video won’t get transferred to the new video, resulting in a pixelated block of mess.

When you make changes to a video with a **video trimmer app**, you’re changing the data structure that holds information about the video. Why do VLC videos that are small in size appear pixelated and blurry? It’s because they don’t have as much information as videos with larger sizes.

## Section 2.  The software you can use to trim VLC videos without loss of quality

Fortunately, there are plenty of video editing programs available online that you can use to trim videos without losing quality. Here are three of the best video cutters:

1. [Wondershare Filmora](#way1)
2. [LosslessCut](#way2)
3. [TunesKit Video Cutter](#way3)

**All three of these video trimmers can be downloaded for free.**

### 1. Trimming VLC with [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Filmora is a powerful [video editor for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Windows. It is a good choice to trim VLC video. You can cut and combine videos without losing the quality. Filmora supports pretty much every video format there is, so you don't have to worry about codecs and containers.

If you’re working with a long video, you can take advantage of Filmora unique feature called “Scene Detection.” With this feature, the software will automatically detect scene changes in the VLC video and separate them, making it easy for you to trim it into multiple clips. If you want to trim your video manually, you can just drag the trimming sliders according to how you want to cut the video.

#### More features of Filmora

* **Effect Plugins:** Cooperate with New Blue & Boris, Filmora allows you to access and use all the fantastic effects from these two outstanding effects producers.
* **Stock Media:** No need to open Chrome or other browser to search for royalty-free images/footages/gifs any more. You can find Giphy, Pixbay, Unsplash within Filmora.
* **Speed Ramping**: Feel free to speed up or slow down a certain video clip.
* **Green Screen:** Get more creative by using Green Screen to create your video.

How to trim VLC video on Mac with Filmora step by step? The following video will introduce you to the detailed steps:

* Pros: With Filmora, you can easily edit VLC video lossless, it is free to download.
* Cons: If you are not a member, the output video may have a watermark.

### 2. Trimming VLC through LosslessCut

LosslessCut is an open-source video cutter that runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac. Like Filmora, this software also allows you to cut videos without re-encoding, so there is no loss of quality. It is user-friendlier than Filmora – all you have to do is drag your video to the software and then you can start trimming it by using the Arrow symbols.

![lossescut for trimming VLC video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/lossescut.jpg)

One unique feature of LosslessCut is that it lets you take JPEG screenshots of the video. It also has a portable version that doesn’t require any installation and can be started directly from a USB.

* Pros: LosslessCut works best with mobile videos or action cams like GoPro.
* Cons: It supports a whole range of video formats, but don’t expect to edit 4K videos using this software. It’s simple and easy to use for a reason.

### 3. Trimming VLC via [TunesKit Video Converter](https://www.tuneskit.com/video-cutter-for-win.html)

TunesKit is a simple video trimmer software that’s available on both Mac and Windows. Unlike Filmora and LosslessCut, TunesKit supports a very limited number of video formats. It is mainly an MP4 video cutter. It works at a much faster speed and there is no loss of quality.

![tuneskit to trim vlc video without lossing quality](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/tuneskit.jpg)

* Pros: The interface, while simpler than Filmora’s, can seem a bit confusing sometimes. TunesKit also has a video editor, which lets you add effects to different segments of the trimmed video, a feature that you probably won’t be using very often. To trim VLC videos in MP4 without re-encoding, you simply have to drag the slider that appears when you import your video.
* Cons: However, its functions may not be as rich as Filmora.

#### Conclusion

If you trim your VLC video, it will result in data loss, which will lead to a reduction in quality. Losing quality is inevitable with most video editors, which is why you should [Download Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) as it's easy to use and has the best and most useful features.

Filmora supports many popular formats like MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, and also different screen resolutions so no matter what the format of your VLC video is, you can easily divide it by scenes using the Scene Detection feature and quickly turn those scenes into clips.

If you intend to host videos on your website, prepare for a myriad of challenges. Hosting videos on one's website has never been a story worth telling. Among the challenges faced include video not playing on mobile phones, website not opening, degraded website speed, video opening, and closing.

These are the reasons why people use video hosting sites like YouTube.

Video hosting platforms keep video codes in a concealed manner which makes it difficult for anyone to decode. This bars those intending to use the video codes to download the video and use it to their advantage.

* **To avoid file format hurdle**

To host a video on a website, the majority of viewers will encounter viewing problems. Different web browsers accept different file formats. For your video to be viewed across all major browsers, it has to be published in many formats. Converting a video from one format to another is a tedious task.

Online video hosting platforms accepts all the following file formats, MPEG4, MP4, 3GPP , WebM, DNxHR, WMV, MPEGPS and WMV among many others.

* **Storage Space and File Size Limitations**

How much space are you allowed to use according to your subscription? Web hosting sites offer limited space to website owners. The more you upload videos and back up your files, the more the storage space becomes smaller. To solve this problem, upload videos first to video hosting service providers then, embed it to your website.

It is really difficult to play a self-hosted video that's above 100MB. Most of the webs hosting providers limit file sizes to 50 MB.

* **Advantage of the Already Huge Traffic**

According to [Business of Apps](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/youtube-statistics/), there are 2 billion monthly active YouTube users. All video hosting service providers have an auto video suggestion feature. Your videos will get views courtesy of traffic from other videos. The more it's viewed, clicked and rated, the better it ranks.

## Why You Should Use Video Hosting Service?

If you intend to host videos on your website, prepare for a myriad of challenges. Hosting videos on one's website has never been a story worth telling. Among the challenges faced include video not playing on mobile phones, website not opening, degraded website speed, video opening, and closing.

These are the reasons why people use video hosting sites like YouTube.

Video hosting platforms keep video codes in a concealed manner which makes it difficult for anyone to decode. This bars those intending to use the video codes to download the video and use it to their advantage.

* **To avoid file format hurdle**

To host a video on a website, the majority of viewers will encounter viewing problems. Different web browsers accept different file formats. For your video to be viewed across all major browsers, it has to be published in many formats. Converting a video from one format to another is a tedious task.

Online video hosting platforms accepts all the following file formats, MPEG4, MP4, 3GPP , WebM, DNxHR, WMV, MPEGPS and WMV among many others.

* **Storage Space and File Size Limitations**

How much space are you allowed to use according to your subscription? Web hosting sites offer limited space to website owners. The more you upload videos and back up your files, the more the storage space becomes smaller. To solve this problem, upload videos first to video hosting service providers then, embed it to your website.

It is really difficult to play a self-hosted video that's above 100MB. Most of the webs hosting providers limit file sizes to 50 MB.

* **Advantage of the Already Huge Traffic**

According to [Business of Apps](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/youtube-statistics/), there are 2 billion monthly active YouTube users. All video hosting service providers have an auto video suggestion feature. Your videos will get views courtesy of traffic from other videos. The more it's viewed, clicked and rated, the better it ranks.

How to rank videos is little known by video creators. Just upload your high-quality videos and watch it become among the top-ranked in your category.

* **Help Upload High-Quality Video**

Most video streaming hosting platforms allow HD (High Definition) video uploads. High Definition videos occupy small spaces and attract more viewers.

To reduce video hosting expenses, free video hosting sites like Vimeo, Dailymotion, and Wistia would be the most suitable. Before you can make select a site, there are important factors that need to be considered.

Here are the best sites and their features;

## Why You Should Use Video Hosting Service?

If you intend to host videos on your website, prepare for a myriad of challenges. Hosting videos on one's website has never been a story worth telling. Among the challenges faced include video not playing on mobile phones, website not opening, degraded website speed, video opening, and closing.

These are the reasons why people use video hosting sites like YouTube.

Video hosting platforms keep video codes in a concealed manner which makes it difficult for anyone to decode. This bars those intending to use the video codes to download the video and use it to their advantage.

* **To avoid file format hurdle**

To host a video on a website, the majority of viewers will encounter viewing problems. Different web browsers accept different file formats. For your video to be viewed across all major browsers, it has to be published in many formats. Converting a video from one format to another is a tedious task.

Online video hosting platforms accepts all the following file formats, MPEG4, MP4, 3GPP , WebM, DNxHR, WMV, MPEGPS and WMV among many others.

* **Storage Space and File Size Limitations**

How much space are you allowed to use according to your subscription? Web hosting sites offer limited space to website owners. The more you upload videos and back up your files, the more the storage space becomes smaller. To solve this problem, upload videos first to video hosting service providers then, embed it to your website.

It is really difficult to play a self-hosted video that's above 100MB. Most of the webs hosting providers limit file sizes to 50 MB.

* **Advantage of the Already Huge Traffic**

According to [Business of Apps](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/youtube-statistics/), there are 2 billion monthly active YouTube users. All video hosting service providers have an auto video suggestion feature. Your videos will get views courtesy of traffic from other videos. The more it's viewed, clicked and rated, the better it ranks.

How to rank videos is little known by video creators. Just upload your high-quality videos and watch it become among the top-ranked in your category.

* **Help Upload High-Quality Video**

Most video streaming hosting platforms allow HD (High Definition) video uploads. High Definition videos occupy small spaces and attract more viewers.

To reduce video hosting expenses, free video hosting sites like Vimeo, Dailymotion, and Wistia would be the most suitable. Before you can make select a site, there are important factors that need to be considered.

Here are the best sites and their features;

This exposition audits writing applicable to every one of these standards and proposes viable ways educators can utilize these standards when using video as an instructive device.

All three components together answer the question of how to make animated educational videos.

### 5\. Which animation software is best for beginners?

## Part 2: FAQ about Education Animation Software

### 1\. How do you make an educational animation video?

If you have set out to make an animation as a teaching aid, then you need the correct type of educational animation software to get you started. Up there with the greats are Renderforest, who let you make tutorials in child-friendly, fun fashion, and Filmora which features all sorts of other plugins to allow you to tailor the suite that you need.

Using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you can replace After Effects, work with a Mac to edit footage, or create animations. There are limitless possibilities with this program – but it does let you create educational animation software pieces that will satisfy even the perfectionists out there.

### 2\. Why is the animation used in education?

The Institute of Progressive Education estimates several reasons why animation helps children learn better. At an early age, the bright color and bold shapes of cartoons help us develop recognition, understand words, and even tell time.

As we grow up, animation triggers the centers of the brain that work best for visual learning. When we insert a moral into a cartoon, it is also more often remembered because of the visuals. It is like the difference between seeing a film and reading a summary of the film.

Educational Animation Software is the tool we use to help create educational animations. It is playing more and more of a role in the teaching world, the deeper we go into the digital age.

### 3\. What are the benefits of using animation in teaching and learning of science subjects?

Animation allows students to develop their understanding by applying rational thinking to their imagination.

Educational Animation software has an especially important place in the teaching of science because it will enable children to understand what is going on at a microscopic level.

It does this by recreating things that cannot be seen by the naked eye. There was a study into this in the Journal of Life Science Education, which focused on cell biology education.

By showing cell mitosis in a cartoon, the teachers can communicate actions that they would never get to see.

### 4\. What makes a good educational video?

**Instructive recordings** have become a significant piece of advanced education, giving a significant substance conveyance device in many flipped, mixed, and online classes.

Successful utilization of video as an instructive device is improved when educators think about three components: how to deal with a psychological heap of the video, how to boost understudy commitment with the video, and how to advance dynamic gaining from the video.

This exposition audits writing applicable to every one of these standards and proposes viable ways educators can utilize these standards when using video as an instructive device.

All three components together answer the question of how to make animated educational videos.

### 5\. Which animation software is best for beginners?

Irrespective of whether these are just your initial steps in the field of animation, it is important to experiment.

So, knowing about alternative software or better ones from what you are using now is much required. You can also look for software that may bring in more versatility to your work. There are always different ways of improving what you are already doing.

Some of the [best animation software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) includes Adobe character animator, Cartoon Animator 4, Stop Motion Studio, DigiCel FlipBook, Moho Pro, and Moho Debut, Toon Boom Harmony, Blender, Pencil2D, Synfig Studio, Animaker, Vyond, Moovly, Wideo, and more.

## Conclusion
