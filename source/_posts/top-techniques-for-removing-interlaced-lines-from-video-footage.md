## Simplest Video Deinterlacing Method to Get Rid of Interlaced Lines

 _Posted by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last update: April 28, 2020_

It is often the case that you get irate by many unwanted mice teeth, combings and serrations in videos displayed on computers, yet do not know how to get rid of those disturbing interlaced lines. The essential reason of this problem lies neither in the computer configurations, nor in the media player quality or the failure of the DV camcorder. It is determined by the way of scanning, which calls for **video deinterlacing** methods to address. And [5Kplayer](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/) will provide you with the easiest solution.

#### **What Is Video Deinterlacing?**

Since there are two ways of scanning â€“interlaced scanning and progressive scanning, both used by HDV camcorder while the latter adopted by computers on a large scale, a video recorded by a HDV camcorder (through interlaced scanning) will suffer a ton of interlacing when it is played (progressively scanned) on computers. Therefore, Video Deinterlacing comes out as the process of converting interlaced video into a non-interlaced form, allowing the videos to be played smoothly without serrations, interlaced lines, or saw tooth type edge distortions on any computer. 

#### **What Methods Can 5KPlayer Provide? - YADIF, BLEND, LINEAR.**

Generally, there are three major categories of deinterlacing methods: field combination, field extension and motion detection. 5KPlayer correspondingly offers the specific methods on its powerful right click:

#### YADIF (Yet Another DeInterlacing Filter)

YADIF checks pixels of previous, current and next frames to re-create the missed field by some local adaptive method and uses spatial check to prevent most artifacts. To deinterlace video, it generates a full picture taking the odd lines from the odd half-picture, and creating the even lines through a complicated algorithm that includes both temporal and spatial interpolation. This choice is most recommended as it is somewhat reasonable and takes most image factors into consideration.

#### Blend

This method can be described as brutal as it mixes information from both half-pictures to produce a blended full picture in order to deinterlace videos. Although it can produce fluid movements, blurred (unsharp) images and ghostlike trails can hardly get cleared off. It is suggested that this mode be used with true interlaced video only, and it will stutter with telecined video.

#### Linear

Linear doubles lines of each interlaced field (consisting of only even or odd lines) to fill the entire frame to realize video deinterlacing, which may result in the video having a frame rate identical to the field rate. Line doubling prevents combing artifacts but causes a noticeable reduction in picture quality since each frame displayed is doubled and really only at the original half field resolution. This is obvious mostly on stationary objects as they will appear to bob up and down.

## Simple Steps to Deinterlace Video with 5KPlayer

**Step 1.** [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) this video deinterlace software -5KPlayer and run it;

**Step 2.** Drag and drop the video you want to deinterlace onto the main interface;

**Step 3.** When the video starts playing, right click on the playing interface and select "Deinterlace"; Then you can choose the deinterlace methods for better video deinterlacing result. 

**Note:** you can try all of those video deinterlacing methods one by one to compare which one works out the best video deinterlacing result.
