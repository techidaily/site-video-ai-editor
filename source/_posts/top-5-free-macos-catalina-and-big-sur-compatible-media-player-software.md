#### **VLC Player – Uncrown King of Media Players for Catalina/Big Sur**

![VLC Player](https://www.5kplayer.com/video-music-player/img/vlc-windows7.jpg) 

That VLC is the uncrowned king of multimedia field has been continuously challenged by many upspringing media players, yet its unshakable popularity stands still no matter how hard they try to struggle forward on whatever platforms. MacOS Catalina/Big Sur is one of the main tracks where those media players go head to head for the "best" title. Fiece as the competition is, we may still have to list VLC as the top media player for macOS Catalina/Big Sur in terms of technical horsepower and settings rather than appearance. 

**Features**:   
All format support  
Handle raw/incomplete materials   
Hardcore users' choice

#### **MPC-HC - Simple & Most Lightweight Media Player Catalina/Big Sur**

 Scarcely had VLC gained its fame, when MPC followed the footsteps. The reason why we think MPC-HC better than MPC-BE is that the former updates more frequently with in-time fixes and renewed library on a routine basis, which is convenient for users to give feedbacks and get solutions. Media Player Classic Home Cinema and MPC-BE frankly are almost in common from average users' perspective (see [which media player classic to download](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/)).

**Features**:  
Most Lightweight player of all  
Highly configurable

#### **[Elmedia Player](https://tools.techidaily.com/eltima/products/) from Eltima - One of the Best Media Players for macOS Catalina/Big Sur**

One of the best media players for macOS Catalina/Big Sur is Elmedia Player for Mac. First off, it supports a wide range of video formats from MP4, MOV, MKV, etc, language switching is optional and Elmedia Player - one of the best media players for Mac may change font colors, and even play damaged video files that the rest of media players for Mac won't do out there in the market.

**Features**:  
Support TIFF PNG GIF screenshots  
Highly configurable

Elegant interface with great capture feature, this media player Catalina/Big Sur is as much a visual attraction as it is a media player. Among other typical multimedia features, Movist is based in part on FFmpeg and can let you switch between QT and FFMPEG on the fly. But it is reported that its most notable subtitle support and apple remote control has been facing troubles on macOS Catalina/Big Sur. 

**Features**:   
Best media player for Catalina/Big Sur following comtemporary aesthetic  
FFmpeg and QT switch

As stated above, there are many choices for users in varied needs and you do not have to stick with one media player on Catalina/Big Sur forever. Making some of those Mac video players your day-to-day alternations won't be a bad idea since when you embrace them, they you. For a quick recommendation, i pick [5KPlayer](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) here for you and hopefully you can take a fresh bite of a new media player revolution.
