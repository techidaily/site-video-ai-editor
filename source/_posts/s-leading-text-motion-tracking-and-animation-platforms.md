Have you ever been mesmerized by a video with text or emoji’s moving together with objects? That effect is produced using motion tracking and isn’t very complicated. Today, we will introduce some text motion tracking software (free & paid) tools that allow you to pin text to video with minimum effort. There will also be detailed tutorials on how to utilize each tool. Let’s get started.

## Best Text Motion Tracking Software \[+Howtos\]

**Note:** The list below is in no particular order.

### 1. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Pricing:** Free (watermark) /starts at $49.99/year

**Operating System:**  Windows & Mac

The newly released Wondershare Filmora X version has added the motion tracking features, which allows you to track moving objects in a video clip, and attach images, texts, elements and videos to follow the movement path.

#### How to Use Filmora Video Editor To Do Text Motion Tracking?

* Import the video footage to the timeline and then click the Motion Track icon in the tool bar to enable the Motion Tracking option.

![ Filmora Motion Tracking  icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/motion-tracking-tool-bar.jpg)

* In the preview window, drag and adjust the tracking box to select a moving object as the target.

![ Filmora Motion Tracking  Box](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-motion-tracking-box.jpg)

* Click the Start Tracking menu to start the moton tracking render, and Filmora video editor will compute the moving path automatically
* Now, go to the Titles tab and drag a subtitle, titles, lower 3rd, or callout to the track just above the motion-tracked video. Customize your texts, adjust its size, position, etc. in the preview window.

![ Filmora Motion Tracking  - Text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/motion-tracking-text.jpg)

* Next, double click the video footage to enter the Motion Track option. Select the title as a follower. Playback the video, and you will see the text will move accordingly.

Below is a step by step video tutorial about how to use the motion tracking feature in Filmora. Keep watching.

### 2. Premiere Pro CC

**Pricing:** 14-day trial, minimum $20.99/month

**Operating System:** Windows, Mac

Adobe Premiere Pro is an industry-leading video editor. Premiere Pro CC has all the editing tools a pro video editor needs.

There is no automatic tracking feature in Premiere Pro to pin text to video. Therefore, you need to manually position your text and add keyframes frame by frame. But the overall effort required and the final result isn’t much different from traditional editors.

#### How To Do Text Motion Tracking In Premiere Pro CC? \[Main Steps\]

* Import your video to the timeline
* Add text by Pressing ‘T’ on your keyboard and clicking on the preview window (your footage)
* Change the position & duration of the text layer on the timeline according to the position & duration of motion tracking
* Make sure you’re on the frame you want to start tracking from
* Click on your text layer → then go to effects controls
* Change the position of the text to the point you want to track → click on the stopwatch icon to add a keyframe
* Move a few frames forward → adjust the position again → add another keyframe
* Don’t put the keyframes too close or too farther apart
* Play through to check it out → adjust the position and number of keyframes if any issues arise

The whole process is relatively easy, although tedious. But the process becomes very complicated when you have more dynamic motion in your clip

### 3. After Effects

**Pricing:** 7-day trial, $20.99/month (individual)

 **Operating System:** Windows & Mac

Adobe After Effects is an editor that focuses on animation & creative composition. This app has been developed as a companion to Premiere Pro for creating short & flashy motion graphics and visual effects for projects.

Motion tracking in After Effects can be done using the Point Tracker, which has one-point and up to four-point tracking. Other tracking options include the built-in 3D Camera Tracker that lets you reverse engineer a scene and the spline tracker that enables you to track masks on an object. There is also Mocha AE, a planar tracker from BorisFX. The Point Tracker is the most flexible and versatile in After Effects. We’ll use it to pin text to video.

#### How To Do Text Motion Tracking In After Effects? \[Main Steps\]

* Create a new composition/open an old one and make sure your clip is imported
* Create a null object by right-clicking on the window (screenshot below)
* Select your clip → click on tracker → click on track motion
* Two square boxes will appear
* Move the squares to the point you want to track (make sure to select an object with relatively high contrast for easier tracking)
* Position the smaller square on the object you want to track
* Make the second box is big enough (not too big) so that the tracked object stays within this square in the next frame
* Click on the analyze forward button (screenshot above)
* If the square box fails to track the object at any frame, reposition it and move on
* Make sure motion target is set to null object (e.g., Null 1)
* Now add the text
* While clicking on the pick whip tool of the text layer, drag it to the null object
* Play through to check the result
* You can manually change the position of the text in any frame by adjusting its position and adding a keyframe

We’re done. As we stated above, other types of trackers are also available for you to experiment with. The overall tracking functionality is much better than Premiere Pro.

### 4. Sony Vegas Pro

**Pricing**: 30-day trial, minimum $19.99/month

**Operating System:**  Windows

Sony Vegas Pro is a non-linear video editor with the so-called “power of Artificial Intelligence.” It is one of the few editors out there that has acquired popularity among professionals and amateurs alike.

Text motion tracking in Vegas Pro is done using Bézier Masking FX (new update introduces a separate tab for motion tracking). The tracking process is automatic. Keyframes are created automatically frame by frame. It isn't perfect, but it gets the job done in most cases. When it fails to track objects correctly, you can manually edit the keyframes.

#### How To Do Text Motion Tracking In Sony Vegas Pro? \[Main Steps\]

* Import your video
* Click on your video → go to the starting point of text motion tracking
* Click on **Bézier Masking** → drag the default one to your video
* A new options tab will appear & a square box with a circle (tracking box) will appear in the preview window
* Go to General options → set blend to 1,000
* Go to Mask 1 → Tracking → options → set the precision to high → set keyframe interval between 1 & 5
* Position the black dot of the tracking box to the point you want to track
* Click on start below the keyframe interval option
* After processing is complete → go to tools → extensions → add text to motion track → click on ok in the text position tab
* Enter your text, edit it if you want
* Play through to check the result

**Conclusion:**

As we've seen above, all the editors have some kind of automatic tracking feature, Premiere Pro being the only manual exception. All of them do a reasonably good job when it comes to pinning text to video. Professionals would be more satisfied with the added versatility and control in After Effects. Filmora, Filmora, Vegas Pro and Premiere Pro, on the other hand, are better suited for amateurs.

* Make sure motion target is set to null object (e.g., Null 1)
* Now add the text
* While clicking on the pick whip tool of the text layer, drag it to the null object
* Play through to check the result
* You can manually change the position of the text in any frame by adjusting its position and adding a keyframe

We’re done. As we stated above, other types of trackers are also available for you to experiment with. The overall tracking functionality is much better than Premiere Pro.

### 4. Sony Vegas Pro

**Pricing**: 30-day trial, minimum $19.99/month

**Operating System:**  Windows

Sony Vegas Pro is a non-linear video editor with the so-called “power of Artificial Intelligence.” It is one of the few editors out there that has acquired popularity among professionals and amateurs alike.

Text motion tracking in Vegas Pro is done using Bézier Masking FX (new update introduces a separate tab for motion tracking). The tracking process is automatic. Keyframes are created automatically frame by frame. It isn't perfect, but it gets the job done in most cases. When it fails to track objects correctly, you can manually edit the keyframes.

#### How To Do Text Motion Tracking In Sony Vegas Pro? \[Main Steps\]

* Import your video
* Click on your video → go to the starting point of text motion tracking
* Click on **Bézier Masking** → drag the default one to your video
* A new options tab will appear & a square box with a circle (tracking box) will appear in the preview window
* Go to General options → set blend to 1,000
* Go to Mask 1 → Tracking → options → set the precision to high → set keyframe interval between 1 & 5
* Position the black dot of the tracking box to the point you want to track
* Click on start below the keyframe interval option
* After processing is complete → go to tools → extensions → add text to motion track → click on ok in the text position tab
* Enter your text, edit it if you want
* Play through to check the result

**Conclusion:**

As we've seen above, all the editors have some kind of automatic tracking feature, Premiere Pro being the only manual exception. All of them do a reasonably good job when it comes to pinning text to video. Professionals would be more satisfied with the added versatility and control in After Effects. Filmora, Filmora, Vegas Pro and Premiere Pro, on the other hand, are better suited for amateurs.

With cool effects and filters, it’s possible to create a wide range of videos that catch the viewer’s attention and put a smile on his face. On the other hand, videos can be created and shared from mobile phones in seconds, enabling its users to show a lot of different situations and express a lot of ideas.

Reversing is also one of the popular options on TikTok and it can be readily performed even without deeper knowledge of video production and editing. Here is how you can do it effectively, either with built-in tools provided by TikTok or with additional pieces of software.

## How to Make A Reversing TikTok Video?

Changing the direction of the video, i.e. playing it backwards, is not hard to achieve on TikTok at all. In fact, there is a dedicated function you can use to reverse your video instantly and without leaving the app.

To activate this function, you need to click on the Effects button at the bottom of the screen and then select the Time effects category. The reverse option can be found in this menu, and it will change the direction of the entire clip.

![Reverse video on TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reverse-video-on-tiktok.jpg)

After you click on Reverse and review your new video, all you need to do is to save the file and it is ready to be shared with the public. The entire process lasts just a few seconds and doesn’t require any technical skills, so anyone can take advantage of this simple effect to create exciting videos that play with the concept of time and resonate with the online audience.

## How to Play Someone Else’s Video in Reverse on TikTok?

TikTok only allows video authors to reverse their own videos if they want, but viewers can’t just watch the videos they see online backwards. They are limited to straightforward viewing, although it is possible to jump forward to any part of the clip.

![Reverse Vid for iOS](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reverse-vid-play-it-backwards.jpg)

The only solution to this limitation involves external playback tools, so if you really want to watch a certain video in reverse you could try to download it to your phone and use a different video player. For example, iPhone owners can pick up a third-party app like [Reverse Vid](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reverse-vid-play-it-backwards/id950551948) from the App Store that lets them use reverse playback. Once the app is installed and the video is stored on the phone, there is nothing preventing the user from watching it backwards on the mobile screen.

## How to Reverse A Video on CupCut And Share It on TikTok?

Users who know a bit more about video editing and want more control over the final product can use external tools instead of TikTok’s own function. There are many video editors for TikTok that could do the trick, but CupCut is one of the simplest apps that will work from your phone and can be downloaded for free.

In CupCut, you can precisely select the part of the video you want to reverse and even adjust playback speed if you want. That gives you more creative freedom and unlocks the possibility to attempt more ambitious visual ideas.

Of course, once you reverse the video in CupCut you will need to export it to TikTok before you can share it with your contacts. Since both of those apps support the same video formats, this process should run very smoothly and without any compatibility issues.

## Is It Possible to Reverse Video and Audio at The Same Time?

In some cases, reversing the audio stream could make the video even more impressive but unfortunately, TikTok doesn’t directly support this possibility. However, more [advanced editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) suits give you the option to have both video and audio run backwards in unison. For example, you can use [Wondershare Filmora](https://filmora.wondershare.net/filmora-video-editor.html) for this purpose and accomplish the task in several easy steps.

First, you need to set up the project to 9:16 [aspect ratio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) since the video will be shared on TikTok. And then you can import the video footage to Filmora.

To reverse the video and audio at the same time, right-click the clip in the timeline and then select **Speed and Duration**. In the Custom Speed window, check the **Reverse Speed** option and click **OK** to save the changes.

Play the clip and you will find the video and audio is reversed at the same time.

If you don’t want to reverse the audio, you can [detach the audio from the video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) first and then reverse the video separately.

When you complete these steps, you are ready to export the video and re-import the reversed clip back into TikTok.

## How to Reverse A TikTok Video on Snapchat?

To share a TikTok video on Snapchat, you should first download the TikTok video and then open Snapchat.

Go to Snapchat Memories and access the camera roll, and then choose the TikTok video. Click the three dots button on the top right of the screen and then click Edit Video. In the editing mode, swipe the screen to left, you will see the video in slow motion, fast motion, and then the rewind effect. Now, the uploaded TikTok is reversed on Snapchat.

## Basic Video Editing Terms You Should Know

Below are some of the important yet basic terms that you should know related to videography in general and video editing in specific as well, whether you are a beginner or professional.

**Aspect ratio:**

The aspect ratio is the ratio of width and height of a video. Examples of the most used aspect ratios are: 4:3, 16:9, 1.85:1.

Refer to the image given below for a better understanding.

![aspec ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/aspec-ratio.jpg)

**B-roll:**

B-roll facilities one with the flexibility, when editing, to the video editing rules as it is an add-on picture that makes a previously incoherent scene seamless.

As shown in the image below, B-roll is used to insert which can make the transition easy to look on the eyes.

**Bit rate:**

Bit rate, also known as data rate, refers to the amount of data used for every second within the video. It is most commonly expressed in kilobits per second (kbps).

**Close up:**

Close-up refers to the shots that frame to subject tightly.

For instance, if it is a person, then the close-up covers solely his face.

**Color temperature:**

Color temperature refers to the light visibility in a shot. Color temperature is expressed in Kelvin. The scale of color temperature ranges from cool to warm.

![color temperature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/color-temperature.jpg)

**Composition:**

Composition entails the process of combining multiple footages using video editing software.

**Compression:**

Compression is the process of minimizing the quantity of data utilized in a video file. It helps make in the process of uploading and downloading quite faster. This also leaves you with ample space for more of your publications.

**Crop factor:**

Crop factor refers to a number that expresses the ratio of the imaging area of a sensor to a full-frame sensor. It typically ranges from 1.3 to 2.0.

**Cut-in**

Cut-in refers to showing a specific part of a subject in order to emphasize a certain aspect or emotion. For instance, hand gestures may show nervousness, enthusiasm, agitation, etc.

**Foley:**

Often times the original sound of the scene captured in the video is not captured as naturally as they were supposed to sound like in reality. Hence, Foley is when you reproduce those sounds for that video.

**Frame rate:**

Frame rate refers to the video capturing by a shutter in a second or shutter cycling rate through opening and closing. Some of the common frame rates are 24, 25, 29.97, 30, etc. The frame rate is expressed in frames per second (fps).

**High definition media interface:**

HDMI is the connectors that digitally transfer audio and HD video to a television. This is helpful if you intend to work on a bigger screen or wish to share some of your productions.

**Resolution:**

Resolution refers to the horizontal and vertical pixels of your video. For instance 640×480 for SD and 1280×720 for HD. Sometimes resolution refers only to the number of pixels that paper vertically. For example 480p, 720p, and 1080p respectively.

![resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/resolution.jpg)

**J-Cut:**

J-cut refers to the editing technique in which the audio from a next scene is overlapped with the image from the previous scene, such that the audio segment of the next scene begins playing prior to its picture.

**Jumpcut:**

Jumpcut editing techniques refer to an abrupt transition between the two consecutive frames. The entity in the video containing jump cuts appears to jump along with the scene from one place to another. This looks disruptive to the audience.

**L-Cut:**

L-cut is exactly opposite to J-cut where the audio from the next scene overlays the image from the next scene to play the audio after an image has been displayed in the video.

**Lower third:**

As the name suggests, the lower third is derived from the rule of third which refers to the type of title, mostly used by vloggers, broadcasters, interviewers, and you tubers.

**Memory bank**:

You can understand the term by thinking of a memory box where we keep certain things as a memory of the events in someone’s life. Memory bank serves the same purpose through the use of video. It often uses natural sounds, document travel or merely store moments in routine life.

**Press kit:**

Press kit is used to provide information regarding your productions to the press for promotional purposes. Such information is often background including synopsis, crew, cast’s bios Q&A with the director, production stills and its reviews.

**Shot list:**

The shot list refers to the checklist related to the shots that a videographer plans to include in his/her content. This may help you save time and gear with efficient planning and handling. This gives a sense of direction to your production.

**Storyboard:**

A storyboard is a drawing to illustrate the scenes in the video. This gives a direct and organized way to visualize the needs for the shots or animation.

![storyboard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/storyboard.jpg)

**Sync:**

Synchronization, aka sync, refers to the alignment of audio with video imaging.

**Rule of thirds:**

The rule of third is a grid that helps you to compose interesting and balanced shots to make your productions aesthetically pleasing. The grid is similar to a tic-tac-toe board since it segregates the picture into 9 segments. It helps bring points of interest to be aligned with the lines or intersection given in the grid.

![rule of thirds](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/rule-of-thirds.jpg)

**Three-point lighting:**

This helps one to diminish the shadows for image balancing and provides an appealing contrast. These three lights are commonly known as fill, key, and backlight.

![three point lighting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/three-point-lighting.jpg)

**Tilts:**

Tilts refer to the vertical transitions that your camera. This is the opposite of pans.

![tilts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/tilts.jpg)

**Pans:**

Pans refer to the horizontal movements of your camera. This is exactly contrary to tilts.

**White balance:**

White balance refers to the process where the unrealistic color casts are removed in order to render a white object to be actually white in your photo, and not have other tints.

![white balance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/white-balance.jpg)

**Wide-angle:**

A wide-angel lens refers to a short focal length of a lens. This brings more of a subject rather than a subject being captured by a normal lens at equal distances.

![wide angle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/wide-angle.jpg)

**Non-linear editing:**

NLEs is a non-destructive editing technique that allows one to access any frame in a video clip regardless of the sequence in the clip. It gives you the freedom to easily include effects, transitions, fades, etc. which cannot be achieved with linear editing

**Pixel aspect ratio:**

Pixels are several tiny squares that build up an image in a video. Whereas, aspect ratio refers to the ratio of width to height of a video. Hence, the pixel aspect ratio (PAR) is the ratio of width to height of the pixels.

## Conclusion

Be it Instagram stories, YouTube product testimonials, or Facebook ads, using these easy-to-use video editing software will elevate your content into a professional and slick look.

So, I hope you are now ready to get started.
