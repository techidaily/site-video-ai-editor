The size of the videos you capture with your Smartphone or digital camera can sometimes be just too large for online use.

PC owners who often upload video content to their social media accounts or run a YouTube channel can **easily compress their footage on Windows 10**. There are a number of options that enable you to reduce the size of a video on the latest version of the Windows OS, but which one you are going to choose depends on a number of factors that range from your preferred method of reducing a video file’s size to how fast the compression process is.

In this article, we are going to take you through **nine best free video compressors for Windows 10** and help you discover the one you feel comfortable using.

* [Part 1: 9 Best Free Video Compressors for Windows 10](#part1)
* [Part 2: How Does Video Compression Work?](#part2)

Before you opt for one free video compressor or the other you must first make sure that its **file compression capabilities** meet your demands. So, let’s take a look at the 9 best free video compressors for Windows 10.

### 1.[Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) \- \[Free trial and Paid subscription\]

If you want to reduce video file size without losing video quality, Filmora can help you reduce video size when you are exporting video. You can choose the different video bitrate, format and quality to reduce video file size. Key features of Wondershare Filmora are listed below.

### 2.[Photos App](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-photos/9wzdncrfjbh4#activetab=pivot:overviewtab)

The Windows 10’s native Photos App offers a broad spectrum of photo and video editing tools that can be used even by novice photo and video editors. Besides the **standard photo editing features** that enable you to enhance your photos in just a few clicks, the [Photos App also lets you **trim**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**, merge or add text overlays and filters to your videos.**

In order to compress a video file with the Photos App, you need to create a new project by clicking on the **New Video** drop-down menu and selecting the **New Video Project** option. You can then import the video clips you want to compress to the project you created and perform all other video editing tasks you want.

![Windows 10 Save

video in small size ](<https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows10-photos-app-compress-video-size.jpg>)

When done, you should click on the **Finish** **video** **button** and choose from **Small, Medium or Large** output video size before you start the video exporting. The only downside is that you **cannot choose the file format of the video you’re exporting from the Photos App.** Even so, you can compress MP4 videos to a smaller size with the Photos App for free, which makes it useful if you want to quickly compress a video before sharing it on social media.

### 3.[VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)

This is probably one of the **[best open-source media players](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**ever created because it supports all video file formats. Besides video playback capabilities, VLC also offers a number of video editing features that can help you remove unwanted parts of video clips or apply filters and effects. There are three different ways to compress a video in VLC.

You can either convert a file **by changing its output file format, adjusting the bitrate and the frame rate** or by cropping and recording segments of the video clip you want to compress.

The fastest and easiest way to reduce a video’s size in VCL is to change its file format. You can do this by clicking on the **Convert/Save option** in the **Media menu**. You can then select one of the available profile presets from the **Profile drop-down menu** and select the option that is best suited for the context in which the video is going to be used. Optionally, you can click on the **Settings icon** next to the Profile drop-down menu in case you would like to adjust a video’s resolution manually.

### 4.[Freemake Video Converter](https://www.freemake.com/free%5Fvideo%5Fconverter/)

Freemake Video Converter is compatible with all versions of the Windows OS that were released since 2006, which makes it one of the **best free video compressors** for Windows 10\. It supports more than **five hundred video file formats**, and it lets you turn photos and audio files into videos.

![Freemake video

converter compress video interface ](<https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/freemake-video-converter-compress-video.jpg>)

## Choosing the best video trimmer for you; desktop or online?

Choosing an online or desktop video trimmer is a decision only you, as a professional, can make. Still, the truth is desktop trimmers work more efficiently than online solutions for a good number of reasons.

Accuracy: Though online video trimmers might look a bit faster than desktop options, it might not give the flexibility to make changes at will like the desktop options.

Efficiency: If you enjoy working without an internet connection, or have issues with a reception where you reside, then the online video trimmers are not for you.

Space: However, online versions are best suited for people using PCs with low storage space and saving space and time. However, if you want to edit generally and not just trim videos alone, most desktop options come with other editing features than trim.

Speed: Also, because you do not have to wait for an internet signal, desktop video trimmers render faster than online video trimmers (though still depending on system speed).

Verdict: It will be best to try desktop video trimmers for major projects. Online solutions are online cool while either doing a test project or for personal use.

## Conclusion

● The fact remains that the efficiency of your editing software or tool has a huge influence on your productivity. And even though choosing the best video trimmer for your next project might seem dicey, following a simple review like this will make it easy to select from the best and try to know what works best for you.

## Choosing the best video trimmer for you; desktop or online?

Choosing an online or desktop video trimmer is a decision only you, as a professional, can make. Still, the truth is desktop trimmers work more efficiently than online solutions for a good number of reasons.

Accuracy: Though online video trimmers might look a bit faster than desktop options, it might not give the flexibility to make changes at will like the desktop options.

Efficiency: If you enjoy working without an internet connection, or have issues with a reception where you reside, then the online video trimmers are not for you.

Space: However, online versions are best suited for people using PCs with low storage space and saving space and time. However, if you want to edit generally and not just trim videos alone, most desktop options come with other editing features than trim.

Speed: Also, because you do not have to wait for an internet signal, desktop video trimmers render faster than online video trimmers (though still depending on system speed).

Verdict: It will be best to try desktop video trimmers for major projects. Online solutions are online cool while either doing a test project or for personal use.
