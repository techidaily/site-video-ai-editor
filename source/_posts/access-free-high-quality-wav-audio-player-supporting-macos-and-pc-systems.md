## Free WAV Player to Play WAV Files on Mac and Windows OS

 _Posted by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last update: April 28, 2020_ 

Are you troubled with WAV playback? Don't worry. This article will introduce a **free WAV player** which is available to play all WAV audio files on Mac and Windows OS without any settings. Here, you can learn what WAV is, what the difference between WAV and MP3 is, and how to play WAV files with the free WAV media player – 5KPlayer. This player can even play the WAV files that cannot be played on Windows Media Player, QuickTime, VLC, etc.

In theory, both Windows Media Player and QuickTime Player support for WAV playback natively. However, to our disappointment, playing WAV files with our default WAV player or other popular media players like [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) is not as easy as we imagine.

_"WAV file won't play in Windows Media Player 11\. Message'an audio Codec is needed to play this file'. I have look all over the place for this codec. I also try VLC and Real Player but no luck. Got the VLC going but no sound."_

_"I usually use VLC because of its reliability. Today, I need to play some WAV files. But VLC plays the WAV files silently. Gnome Media Player also plays them silently. Any ideas about how to play WAV files?"_

What to do when you fail to play WAV files? WAV won't playback issue may happen due to the lack of correct codec packs or something wrong with your sound device configuration. Thus, you should download and install codec or make some correct configuration. If you believe the solutions are very difficult for you, how about convert WAV to MP3? But it is not a recommended practice. There's big difference between WAV and MP3\. WAV (WAVE) short for Waveform Audio File Format is an audio file format standard jointly developed by Microsoft and IBM for storing an audio bitstream on PCs. WAV is an uncompressed or lossless format, while MP3 is compressed or lossy. That is to say, if you convert WAV to MP3, there must be some loss in quality. For novices and audiophile fans, a **professional one-click free WAV player** like 5KPlayer is the best way out.

5KPlayer is a professional [free music player](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) capable of playing WAV, APE, FLAC, MP3, M4A, AAC, WMA, MIDI, AIF and other lossless/lossy audio file formats. It comes with all codecs needed and enables users to play any music files directly without the need to configure anything. Just download this free WAV player and enjoy your WAV files right now.
