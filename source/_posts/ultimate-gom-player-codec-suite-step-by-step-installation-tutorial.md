As a free media player, GOM Player is originally famous for its searching and built-in extension features like searching video and auidio codecs and searching movie subtitles from its database. However, there are still dozens of video codec out there and instructions are driving you nuts. How to download and install codec pack for GOM Player? You get the easiest way here.

## How to Use Codec Finder on GOM Player and Install Codecs for Gom Player

**Method 1:** When a media file fails to open in GOM Player, the Codec Finder will automatically show up. Hit the "Find Codec" button to download the corresponding codec and you will get a file with ".download" extension. Do make sure that you change the extension to ".exe" for installation.

## What If GOM Player Is Unable to Determine Which Codec Is missing?

 Three plans are here in suggested:  
 1\. Download GOM Player codec pack from third party sources.  
 2\. [Convert the incompatible codec file](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/youtube-download/) to GOM supported ones.  
 3\. Turn to another media player if you don't particularly have to stick with GOM. 

## 1\. Where and How to Download GOM Player Codec Pack?

Searching for specific GOM Player codec ac3, GOM Player codec MKV one by one is quite frustrating, why can't we get GOM Player with full codec download and solve the problem at once to avoid "Find Codec" dialog? Yes you can. But GOM official site provides limited codec for download like XVD videos in .xvd or vg2\. To get other codecs, you can download and install complete 3rd party [codec pack](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) for GOM Player like CCCP, K-lite etc from their official sites. 

Note: We and GOM & Company do not officially endorse or recommend the installation of any additional codecs/codec pack, and cannot be held responsible for any problems or damages that arise from installing 3rd-party codecs. No matter for codec installation or codec pack download, there is always some unpredictable risks for which you shall be held responsible.
