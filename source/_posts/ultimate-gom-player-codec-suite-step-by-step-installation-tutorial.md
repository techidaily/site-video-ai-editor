## What If GOM Player Is Unable to Determine Which Codec Is missing?

 Three plans are here in suggested:  
 1\. Download GOM Player codec pack from third party sources.  
 2\. [Convert the incompatible codec file](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/youtube-download/) to GOM supported ones.  
 3\. Turn to another media player if you don't particularly have to stick with GOM. 

## 1\. Where and How to Download GOM Player Codec Pack?

Searching for specific GOM Player codec ac3, GOM Player codec MKV one by one is quite frustrating, why can't we get GOM Player with full codec download and solve the problem at once to avoid "Find Codec" dialog? Yes you can. But GOM official site provides limited codec for download like XVD videos in .xvd or vg2\. To get other codecs, you can download and install complete 3rd party [codec pack](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) for GOM Player like CCCP, K-lite etc from their official sites. 

Note: We and GOM & Company do not officially endorse or recommend the installation of any additional codecs/codec pack, and cannot be held responsible for any problems or damages that arise from installing 3rd-party codecs. No matter for codec installation or codec pack download, there is always some unpredictable risks for which you shall be held responsible.

This great multi media player includes almost all popular and less popular codecs for almost all media files so that you do not need to search for additional codec installation, perfectly standalone and one-stop on its own.
