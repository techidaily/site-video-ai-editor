 _Posted by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last update: April 28, 2020_

Trying hard to find the best free **DVD player software** download for Windows 10 and Mac? Tested quite a few, only to find that BS player does not play DVD unless you buy the Pro version and GOM player doesn't support DVDs and RealPlayer also needs to be upgraded to Plus version to enable the DVD playback function? Doesn't matter, because now you are about to discover the amazing functions of the most welcomed free DVD player software for both Windows 10 and Mac – 5KPlayer!

### Part 1\. About DVD and DVD Related Video Formats

Digital Video Disc (DVD) refers to a format, designed for digital optical disc storage, developed by the joint effort of Philips, Sony, Toshiba, and Panasonic in 1995, can be played by free DVD player software. 18 generations including DVD-1 to DVD-18 ranging from DVD-R/RW, DVD+R/RW (plus), DVD-RAM, and read-only formats BD-ROM, DVD ROM, DVD-D, DVD Plus have come into being. Generally a complete DVD file consists video\_ts and audio\_ts, otherwise a DVD file can hardly be read by any of your DVD player software on computers. 

The most advanced Blu-ray DVD and HD DVD provide amazing storage spaces up to 50GB and 30GB, and DVD DS DL can store up to 15.9GB, proving DVD actually one of the most ideal storage medium that cannot be easily replaced by digital cloud drive or hard-drive entirely. To that end, a professional DVD player software is a must-have in the coming couple of decades for Windows (10) or Mac computer. 

Back to the infant stage when DVDs are protected by CSS (Content Scrambling System), DVDs bought in Japan (region 2) cannot be played in America (region 1). However, as software develops and [region free DVD players](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) are on the market, downloading a region-free DVD player can cast away all region code restrictions. Once you obtain an all-in-one DVD player download for Windows 10 or Mac with DVD-capable optical drive, you can enjoy watching DVD videos on computers directly. 

### Part 2\. Why We Play DVDs on Computer With Free DVD Player Software?

Playing DVD on Windows/Mac computer grants the easiest control over audio and video, where you can take snapshots, rip and AirPlay DVD content to target devices. After the discontinuation of Windows Media Center on Windows 10, [Windows DVD Player app](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) has been designated as the official choice on Windows APP Store at an absurd price - $14.99, yet even without supports for Blu-ray. Also note that this fee-based DVD player for Windows 10 provides only x86 and x64 builds, and cannot be install on limited 10 devices. Therefore, we recommend you free DVD player [5KPlayer](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/) to jump out of these confines!
