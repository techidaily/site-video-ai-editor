Making videos and shooting short films has been growing in popularity for several reasons, among them the proliferation of high-traffic sharing sites like YouTube, and the increased availability of professional quality camcorders and video devices. It's very easy today to become proficient enough to shoot high-quality videos for entertainment, for business and to assist with teaching. Sony is one of the brands that are popular with video makers, and in this tutorial we walk you through the steps on editing videos shot by Sony camcorder.

## How to Edit Videos Shot by Sony Digital Camcorder

### Video editing software for Sony camcorder

Video editing software is tiered by level, with options available for basic, mediate, and advanced programs. Here's a closer look at select software options:

* [Basic Editing Software for Sony Digital Camcorders](#part1)
* [Mediate Editing Software for Sony Digital Camcorders](#part2)
* [Advanced Editing Software for Sony Digital Camcorders](#part2)

### Basic Editing Software for Sony Digital Camcorders

#### 1\. Wondershare Filmora

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) (Latest version X) is not only one of the most affordable video editing software options, it's also one of the most advanced. The interface is simple, but there are numerous advanced features available, including overlays, filters, audio editing features and more.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 2\.  Windows Movie Maker

It comes free with Windows, is designed with ease-of-use in mind and offers a surprisingly robust package of features. Convenience and simplicity make Windows Movie Maker the top free video editing software.

### Mediate Editing Software for Sony Digital Camcorders

#### 1\. Magix Movie Edit Pro

It excels in areas of advanced features, formats supported and attractive interface. However, it loses points for slow rendering performance and some complexity in the interface. The low price makes the exchange worth it for many users.

![video editor for sony camcorder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/magix-video-pro-interface.jpg)

#### 2\. Lightworks

It has an extensive list of features and capabilities that provide as near to professional performance as you can find in a free video editing program. The learning curve is a little steep, but if you're willing to invest the time then you have access to a powerful program.

![video editor for sony camcorder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lightworks.jpg)

### Advanced Editing Software for Sony Digital Camcorders

#### 1\. Movie Studio 13 Suite

It is from Sony, so you can expect that it works well with Sony digital camcorders. The interface is more inviting than is usually the case with a product aimed at professionals and the roster of advanced features is top-notch. Other than the price, there are very few drawbacks to this product.

![video editor for sony camcorder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/movie-studio.jpg)

**Final tip**: Understand what you want and balance your needs against your budget and your interest in learning a new application, then you will be able to select the best software to edit videos shot on your Sony camcorder.

## How to edit videos shot by Sony camcorder

How easy is it to edit videos shot by Sony digital camcorder? This easy:

* **Step 1**: Shoot your video
* **Step 2**: Transfer the video from camcorder to computer (using either USB connection or using the SD card).

Steps 1 and 2 are so easy they need no explanation. Step 3 is where you might need some help and some explanation of your options for editing videos shot by Sony digital camcorder is worthwhile.

## Measure and Modify Image Proportionality

You might have noticed that earlier DVDs came with full screen or widescreen viewing choices. Moreover, when you choose the wrong option, it cuts off the movie parts, or the video gets surrounded by black padding.

The standard resolution of your screen stretched from a 4:3 aspect ratio to the wider one. So, producers started making movies that fit on both screens. After the standardization of aspect ratio display, broadcasters pay attention to the image ratio of clips.

So, below is the guide to find, calculate and adjust image ratio with a picture ratio calculator. Let's get started.

#### In this article

01 [What is the image ratio?](#Part 1)

02 [Where Can I Find the Image ratio?](#Part 2)

03 [How to adjust image ratio](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is the image ratio?

The image or aspect ratio is the ratio of width to the height of a picture without any pixels attached. It is expressed with two a colon that separates two numbers, for example, 16:9.

In cinematography, common image ratios are 1.85:1 and 2.39:1, and in TV photography, it is 4:3 and 16:9\. However, in still photography, the standard aspect ratio is 3:2.

## Part 2 Where Can I Find the Image ratio?

To select the right photo print size, you must consider the photo ratio and the print ratio. You can not accidentally choose the balance that needs cropping from the sides of the photo.

So, first, you must know how or where you can find the image ratio. The following are the methods to do so:

### Method 1: Check your Camera

The image ratio depends directly on the camera's sensor. You can find the correct balance for photo print based on your camera type. For example, APS-C and Full-frame cameras shoot in a 3:2 ratio. But compact cameras often shoot in a 4:3 ratio.

The photos that you click with your smartphones have a 16:9 or 4:3 ratio. The picture below shows some common photo ratios by type of camera and where it will look great in the home.

![ Common image Ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/calculate-find-and-adjust-image-ratio-1.jpg)

### Method 2: Find Image Information

Unlike the photo ratios, image information determines the original width and height of the image in pixels. You can measure the picture dimensions in any unit, but you will always see the web or digital images in pixels.

Always remember that two different pictures with the same image ratio may not have the same dimensions. For example, a picture with size 1920X1080 pixels and a photo with size 1280x720 pixels can both have a 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Method 3: Check with Photoshop

You can quickly check the image ratio in Photoshop (picture ratio calculator) using a crop tool. To do so, follow the steps mentioned below:

**●** Open the image in Photoshop.

**●** Choose a crop tool.

**●** Select the photo ratio.

**●** Test different image ratios. You can begin with the standard ratios like 3:2, 16:9, 4:3, or 5:4.

**●** If the crop frame captures the whole picture, it means you have already found the correct ratio.

Do you want a photo print in panorama or square shape? If yes, crop the picture to make it fit a different image ratio. For instance, edit the photo to fit a 1:1 ratio for a square shape.

Or crop a picture to 2:1\. 3:1\. 4:1, 5:1, or 6:1 ratio for a panorama photo.

![Photoshop testing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/calculate-find-and-adjust-image-ratio-2.jpg)

### Method 4: Image Ratio Calculation

You can find the image ratio using the resolution of a photo easily on a window's system. To do so, right-click on an image file and scroll down to the Properties. Under details, you will notice, size of a photo in pixels.

To calculate the photo ratio, divide the width by the height of an image. If the total is an integer, multiply it by other numbers. These numbers are photo ratios.

**Example 1:**

**●** Photo is 4966px by 3312px

**●** Divide 4966 by 3312= 1.5

**●** Now, multiply 1.5 with 2 to obtain a whole number (1.5 X 2= 3)

**●** The photo's ratio is 3:2

**Example 2:**

**●** Photo is 4416 x 3312 px

**●** Divide 4416 by 3312= 1.3

**●** Multiply 1.3 with 3 to obtain a whole number(1.3 x 3= 3.9 or approx. 4)

**●** The photo's ratio is 4:3

## Part 3 How to adjust image ratio

Image ratio is significant in the videography business. But adjusting the video aspect ratio is more critical. Therefore, if you are a video editor, you must know how to do it. There are plenty of options to adjust the aspect ratio, and one of them is to use a photo aspect ratio calculator.

If you want to make permanent adjustments, use a convertor or editor. "Wondershare Filmora" is the best video editor that allows you to create videos with different aspect ratios and adjust these ratios easily.

The image ratio depends directly on the camera's sensor. You can find the correct balance for photo print based on your camera type. For example, APS-C and Full-frame cameras shoot in a 3:2 ratio. But compact cameras often shoot in a 4:3 ratio.

The photos that you click with your smartphones have a 16:9 or 4:3 ratio. The picture below shows some common photo ratios by type of camera and where it will look great in the home.

![ Common image Ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/calculate-find-and-adjust-image-ratio-1.jpg)

### Method 2: Find Image Information

Unlike the photo ratios, image information determines the original width and height of the image in pixels. You can measure the picture dimensions in any unit, but you will always see the web or digital images in pixels.

Always remember that two different pictures with the same image ratio may not have the same dimensions. For example, a picture with size 1920X1080 pixels and a photo with size 1280x720 pixels can both have a 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Method 3: Check with Photoshop

You can quickly check the image ratio in Photoshop (picture ratio calculator) using a crop tool. To do so, follow the steps mentioned below:

**●** Open the image in Photoshop.

**●** Choose a crop tool.

**●** Select the photo ratio.

**●** Test different image ratios. You can begin with the standard ratios like 3:2, 16:9, 4:3, or 5:4.

**●** If the crop frame captures the whole picture, it means you have already found the correct ratio.

Do you want a photo print in panorama or square shape? If yes, crop the picture to make it fit a different image ratio. For instance, edit the photo to fit a 1:1 ratio for a square shape.

Or crop a picture to 2:1\. 3:1\. 4:1, 5:1, or 6:1 ratio for a panorama photo.

![Photoshop testing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/calculate-find-and-adjust-image-ratio-2.jpg)

### Method 4: Image Ratio Calculation

You can find the image ratio using the resolution of a photo easily on a window's system. To do so, right-click on an image file and scroll down to the Properties. Under details, you will notice, size of a photo in pixels.

To calculate the photo ratio, divide the width by the height of an image. If the total is an integer, multiply it by other numbers. These numbers are photo ratios.

**Example 1:**

**●** Photo is 4966px by 3312px

**●** Divide 4966 by 3312= 1.5

**●** Now, multiply 1.5 with 2 to obtain a whole number (1.5 X 2= 3)

**●** The photo's ratio is 3:2

**Example 2:**

**●** Photo is 4416 x 3312 px

**●** Divide 4416 by 3312= 1.3

**●** Multiply 1.3 with 3 to obtain a whole number(1.3 x 3= 3.9 or approx. 4)

**●** The photo's ratio is 4:3

## Part 3 How to adjust image ratio

Image ratio is significant in the videography business. But adjusting the video aspect ratio is more critical. Therefore, if you are a video editor, you must know how to do it. There are plenty of options to adjust the aspect ratio, and one of them is to use a photo aspect ratio calculator.

### Method 5: Adjust Aspect Ratio at Exporting

You can save the clip to your system or smartphones, depending on your requirements. Then, upload them directly to Youtube or burn them into DVD by clicking on the "Export button." In this way, you can watch it on widescreen or standard TV whenever you want with an image size aspect ratio calculator.

![Upload or Burn by Clicking on Export Button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/output-format.jpg)

**●** Adjust Aspect Ratio for the Local Computer

First, you will see the "Local" tab. There you can save the clip in a particular aspect ratio to your system. You can see all resolutions with various aspect ratios after selecting the format. The output video depends on the media click resolution.

**●** Adjust Aspect Ratio for a Device

Change the "Device" tab to save the video in formats compatible with popular devices, including iPod, iPhone, PSP, iPad, etc. Choose your favorite or the best resolution. Once you choose the device, you will see all resolutions.

The video quality will continue improving with higher resolutions. But it will also increase the size of the file.

**●** Adjust Aspect Ratio for YouTube

Go to the "YouTube" tab and fill in the information. Then, click the "Export" button. Selecting the aspect ratio again is not necessary. It will directly upload your videos to YouTube.

**●** Adjust Aspect Ratio for DVD TV

When you go to the "DVD" tab, you will notice various aspect ratio options. Switching the aspect ratio for TV from 4:3 to 16:9 is pretty straightforward. To do so, select what you think is right. Try to use image size aspect ratio calculator to get the right ratio.

## Conclusion

**●** Aspect ratio holds great importance in the proper display. So, it would be best to learn the calculation and adjustment of the image ratio using photo aspect ratio calculator or image size proportion calculator.

**●** Hopefully, the above points will help you to learn calculation and adjustment processes. Also, do not forget to use Wondersahe Filmora to set the image ratio and edit the video with ease.
