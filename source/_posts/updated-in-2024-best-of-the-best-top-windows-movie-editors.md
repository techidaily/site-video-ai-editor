# Best Video Collage Apps for iPhone and iPad

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg)

##### Shanoon Cox

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

We all record more videos with our Smartphones or cameras than we can possibly share on social media, and we often don’t get the chance to show some of our favorite moments to our friends. Video collage apps for iPhones and iPads offer an easy solution to this problem because they enable you to merge multiple video clips into a single video. You don’t even need to have advanced video editing skills in order to create visually stunning video collages, as most of these apps are extremely easy to use. So in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best video collage apps of iOS devices.

## Best Free and Paid Video Collage Apps for iPhone and iPad

Even though selecting a video collage app isn’t a very complicated process, there are still a number of factors you need to consider before you choose to install a video collage app on your iPad or iPhone. Checking the list of features an app offers and making sure that it allows you to adjust each clip you include in a collage separately or to add music to your creations will help you determine if the app you’re interested in is the right choice for you. The selection of video collage presets or the border and background adjustment features should also be considered while choosing a video collage app. Let’s take a look at some of the best video collage apps you can find at the AppStore.

#### 1. [Video Collage and Photo Grid](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photogrid-video-collage-maker/id543577420)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 8 or later

![Video Collage Making Apps for iPhone & iPad ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-collage-and-photo-grid.jpg)

As its name suggests, this app allows you to create both photo and video collages. You can either use the existing material from your camera roll or use the Video Collage and Photo Grid app to capture new footage. You can choose from 64 fully customizable layouts and pick the texture or the color of the frames of each video or photo you include in the collage. The app also lets you adjust the sizes of the still and moving images you’re combining and it also offers the possibility to crop photos you’d like to use in your collages. The sound volume can be easily adjusted, but you must make an in-app purchase in order to unlock the background music feature.

#### 2. [PicPlayPost Movie Video Editor](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/picplaypost-video-editor/id498127541)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 10.3 or later

![PicPlayPost Movie Video Editor - Video Collage Making App ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/picplaypost-video-editor.jpg)

This versatile app can be used for much more than just creating video collages, as it offers the option to capture videos in Full HD and 4K resolutions, although the 4K option is only available on iPhone Xs and iPad Pro. Moreover, you can combine several video collages into a single video and apply a variety of transitions to ensure the smooth flow of the output video. Adding text layers, recording voiceovers or creating soundtracks for your video collages are just a few options you’ll have at your disposal if you install the PicPlayPost movie video editor on your iOS-based device. In case you’re planning on using this app on a daily basis, you should consider purchasing the Everything Pack that costs just $24.99\.

#### 3. [PicStich](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pic-stitch-collage-editor/id454768104)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 10.0 or later

![Video Collage Making Apps for iPhone & iPad ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pic-stitch-collage-editor.jpg)

The fact that PicStich offers more than 300 different layouts speaks volumes about its capabilities. However, the majority of the app’s features are designed to help you create photo collages. You can still add a song you like to a video collage to make it more entertaining to watch, but unfortunately, PicStich doesn’t let you apply transitions or adjust playback speeds of the videos you include in a video collage. Purchasing Frames and Borders packs will extend the scope of your options and enable you to increase the quality of the video collages you’re making. The app’s file-sharing capabilities are impressive since you can export your projects directly to Instagram or Dropbox and you can also share all of your creations to Facebook, Twitter, and other popular social networks.

#### 4. [PhotoGrid - Pic Collage Maker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photogrid-video-pic-editor/id543577420)

We all record more videos with our Smartphones or cameras than we can possibly share on social media, and we often don’t get the chance to show some of our favorite moments to our friends. Video collage apps for iPhones and iPads offer an easy solution to this problem because they enable you to merge multiple video clips into a single video. You don’t even need to have advanced video editing skills in order to create visually stunning video collages, as most of these apps are extremely easy to use. So in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best video collage apps of iOS devices.

## Best Free and Paid Video Collage Apps for iPhone and iPad

Even though selecting a video collage app isn’t a very complicated process, there are still a number of factors you need to consider before you choose to install a video collage app on your iPad or iPhone. Checking the list of features an app offers and making sure that it allows you to adjust each clip you include in a collage separately or to add music to your creations will help you determine if the app you’re interested in is the right choice for you. The selection of video collage presets or the border and background adjustment features should also be considered while choosing a video collage app. Let’s take a look at some of the best video collage apps you can find at the AppStore.

#### 1. [Video Collage and Photo Grid](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photogrid-video-collage-maker/id543577420)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 8 or later

![Video Collage Making Apps for iPhone & iPad ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-collage-and-photo-grid.jpg)

As its name suggests, this app allows you to create both photo and video collages. You can either use the existing material from your camera roll or use the Video Collage and Photo Grid app to capture new footage. You can choose from 64 fully customizable layouts and pick the texture or the color of the frames of each video or photo you include in the collage. The app also lets you adjust the sizes of the still and moving images you’re combining and it also offers the possibility to crop photos you’d like to use in your collages. The sound volume can be easily adjusted, but you must make an in-app purchase in order to unlock the background music feature.

#### 2. [PicPlayPost Movie Video Editor](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/picplaypost-video-editor/id498127541)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 10.3 or later

![PicPlayPost Movie Video Editor - Video Collage Making App ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/picplaypost-video-editor.jpg)

This versatile app can be used for much more than just creating video collages, as it offers the option to capture videos in Full HD and 4K resolutions, although the 4K option is only available on iPhone Xs and iPad Pro. Moreover, you can combine several video collages into a single video and apply a variety of transitions to ensure the smooth flow of the output video. Adding text layers, recording voiceovers or creating soundtracks for your video collages are just a few options you’ll have at your disposal if you install the PicPlayPost movie video editor on your iOS-based device. In case you’re planning on using this app on a daily basis, you should consider purchasing the Everything Pack that costs just $24.99\.

#### 3. [PicStich](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pic-stitch-collage-editor/id454768104)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 10.0 or later

![Video Collage Making Apps for iPhone & iPad ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pic-stitch-collage-editor.jpg)

The fact that PicStich offers more than 300 different layouts speaks volumes about its capabilities. However, the majority of the app’s features are designed to help you create photo collages. You can still add a song you like to a video collage to make it more entertaining to watch, but unfortunately, PicStich doesn’t let you apply transitions or adjust playback speeds of the videos you include in a video collage. Purchasing Frames and Borders packs will extend the scope of your options and enable you to increase the quality of the video collages you’re making. The app’s file-sharing capabilities are impressive since you can export your projects directly to Instagram or Dropbox and you can also share all of your creations to Facebook, Twitter, and other popular social networks.

## Part1: The Best Video Courses For Final Cut Pro in YouTube

Finding good Final Cut Pro X tutorials on YouTube may be like looking for a needle in a haystack. Millions of videos on the internet promise to teach Final Cut tips and tricks, but only a handful of them deliver the degree of training you require.

Even if you discover competent video editing teachers on YouTube, there's a high chance they won't teach you how to use the particular program function you need. It's incredibly aggravating to spend so much time looking for what you need!

But don't lose heart just yet. You can discover a professional video editing instructor that offers a variety of free lessons, tips, and tools for beginners and professionals with a bit of assistance.

Check out our top 5 Recommendations to learn Final Cut Pro on YouTube before you waste hours scanning through dozens of videos:

### 1.FCPX Tour – Final Cut Pro Tips from Basic to Advance

This isn't a regular tutorial; instead, it's a presentation. On the other hand, this channel physically walks you through capturing footage, transferring it to your timeline, and then starting to edit it. Everything from music to speech to light color grading to a quick exporting procedure is covered in this video. After seeing this tutorial, there's no chance you won't grasp how to edit a video. It's just good, reliable information.

### 3.Marcos Rocha – A Heaven for Advanced Techniques

Having mastered the basics, let's move on to some advanced workflow ideas. It takes some time to become comfortable enough (when editing) to experiment with keyboard shortcuts and workflow shortcuts. This is the beauty of editing. Watching lessons on this channel will assist you in putting some of these advanced concepts, shortcuts, and tips into practice as they become second nature to you.

![the-best-fcpx-maroos rocha](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-3.jpg)

• Great for shortcuts, tips, and advanced concepts of FCPX.

• Efficient workflow and easy-to-understand videos.

• Even beginners can benefit from these tutorials.

### 4.Brad and Donna – Game-Changing Plugins

Everyone needs and appreciates free things, whether they're new to FCPX or a professional editor. Your budget will not always be sufficient, and you will frequently find yourselves at a fork in the road when the funds are few. So, the good news for FCPX editors is that there is a slew of free plugins, including overlays, LUTs, flares, and titles, that are very excellent (and don't seem like your dingus friend produced them). You can watch the tutorial course if you want to learn more about these free and paid plugins in all price ranges.

![the-best-fcpx-tutorial-brad-and-donna](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-4.jpg)

**Why recommend this channle?**

• Informative FCPX videos.

• Tips about various effects, color grading, graphics, keyframes, etc.

• Posts new content every week.

### 5.Totally Exposed – Complete Guide for Beginners

Are you new to Final Cut Pro X and don't know where to start? If you're new to FCPX and want to get started with video editing, you can join this FREE hour-long in-depth training that will get you up and running in no time!

![the-best-fcpx-tutorial-totally-exposed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-5.jpg)

When you're learning from a seasoned expert, it's easy to feel left behind as they go through tools and features you've never heard of. On the other hand, the Totally Exposed channel puts such concerns to rest with one-of-a-kind lessons in which we learn with Neil, a novice who has never used FCP X before.

Importing, basic terminologies, cutting clips, and adding music, as well as adding effects, titles, and exporting the finished material, are all covered in this video. It's more of a trawling movie than a fast instruction at over one hour long. However, it's ideal for novice users who want to take things a little more slowly and absorb knowledge over time.

**Why recommend this channle?**

• Extensive yet still very well-paced for beginners.

• Amazing teaching skills.

However, all the video tutorials are quite long because FCPX is powerful but not easy to get started with. You can always choose Wondershare Filmora to boost your editing.

## Part2: **The Best Websites to Read about Final Cut Pro Basics**

If you are looking for the best websites to learn Final Cut Pro basics, then you can visit the following web pages:

### 1.[FCP.co](https://fcp.co/)

![the-best-fcpx-tutorial-fcp-co](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-6.jpg)

FCP.co is dedicated to all things video on the Mac, focusing on Final Cut Pro X video editing techniques and lessons. They're continuously updated on the latest FCPX third-party plugins and filters (including many free effects). Unlike Apple's FCPX user forum, this one is quite active and updated frequently.

### 2.[Apple Support Center](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/resources/)

![the-best-fcpx-tutorial-apple-support-center](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-7.jpg)

On Apple's official website, the FCPX support community is active. If you have a specific query regarding the application, this is an excellent resource. The emphasis here is less on editing style, and skill since most content focuses on more technical FCPX software/hardware concerns. It's worth mentioning that if you contribute to the community by assisting other users with their problems rather than just asking questions, your editing karma will skyrocket!

### 3.[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/finalcutpro/)

![the-best-fcpx-tutorial-reddit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-8.jpg)

If you want to ask a specific question related to Final Cut Pro, you can post it on Reddit. The active community on Reddit will answer it. You can also read the questions posted by other users to increase your knowledge.

### 4.[FCPX.tv](https://fcpx.tv/)

![the-best-fcpx-tutorial-fcpx-tv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-9.jpg)

FCPX.tv, with its motto "all things Final Cut Pro X," is a one-stop shop for the most up-to-date advice and news on this software. An endless list of Final Cut Pro X requests (for future versions and upgrades), FCPX editing lessons, and documentation of known FCPX issues are just a few of the highlights. If you're an FCPX power editor, this is a must-visit website.

## Part3: Is Paid Class of FCPX Worth For Beginners?

The last thing you want to do with your hectic schedule is sitting through hours of aimless video lessons. Buying Final Cut Pro lessons gives you the feel of having a personal trainer working alongside you. You can enroll in FCPX paid courses on Udemy and Coursera. Often a certificate of completion is available for download at the end of the course.

However, if you are a beginner, we won't recommend you buy paid courses. There is unlimited free content related to Final Cut Pro available on YouTube and other websites that you can access without spending a penny.

When you have to spend too much money and energy on an editing tool, consider if it's really worth it. Rather, you can always choose a much easier yet still powerful editor like Filmora to save your time for better editing.

The last thing you want to do with your hectic schedule is sitting through hours of aimless video lessons.

Often a certificate of completion is available for download at the end of the course.

However, if you are a beginner, we won't recommend you buy paid courses. There is unlimited free content related to Final Cut Pro available on YouTube and other websites that you can access without spending a penny.

When you have to spend too much money and energy on an editing tool, consider if it's really worth it. Rather, you can always choose a much easier yet still powerful editor like Filmora to save your time for better editing.

On Apple's official website, the FCPX support community is active. If you have a specific query regarding the application, this is an excellent resource.

# How to Crop a Video with Avidemux

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

Cropping a video, to bring focus onto the important aspects and remove the extraneous parts of the scene, is one of the most valuable tools available to a video editor. It can be used as mentioned to ensure the viewer focuses on what is important, but also to magnify objects on the screen, such as with footage of nature. It has many uses, and one of the best tools available for cropping video is the free program Avidemux. Here we are going to go through the process of getting Avidemux running on your system and cropping some video.

---

If Avidemux is too complicate for you, you can consider [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which is an easy-to-use video editing tool to crop videos within several click. Download the free trial version blow.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## How to Crop a Video with Avidemux

#### 1\. Installation

You can find [Avidemux for download here](http://fixounet.free.fr/avidemux/), it is available for a wide range of platforms, just download the version that fits your needs. Once downloaded, install in the standard way for your platform, this is the Wndows version (64bit).

One point of note during installation is that you can choose which parts of the program you wish to install. It is a very small footprint and for the best performance it is wise to simply install everything.

![Installation2](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/installation2.png)

Once installed you will be presented with the program as seen here.

![Installation3](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/installation3.png)

#### 2\. Importing Video

The next step is importing video. This can be done in two ways, by clicking the file folder icon at the top left you open a standard file browser to navigate to, and select your chosen video file, or alternatively you can simply drag you video into the main panel to import it.

![Importing Video1](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/importing-video1.png)

Whichever route you take, you will end up with your video file loaded in like this.

![Importing Video2](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/importing-video2.png)

Now you can edit the video as you need, Avidemux contains a wealth of features to enable the full spectrum of editing tasks to be completed. However, here we are going to look at the cropping tool, so on to the next step.

#### 3\. Editing Video

Avidemux has some idiosyncrasies in terms of operation, one of those is that to be able to edit any video, you have to choose your output format. Don’t worry though, this is easy, just use the dropdown at the side to choose the output format you want as can be seen here.

![Editing Video](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/editing-video.png)

Once that is set you are free to start editing your footage.

#### 4\. Cropping

It is important to understand how the editing process works in Avidemux, everything is accessed via the filters menu Video>Filters and from here you are faced with a new interface that enables you to choose the component you wish to use.

![Cropping1](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping.png)

Selecting ‘Crop’ from the menu and pressing the green plus symbol at the bottom activated the crop tool and presents you with yet another view that allows you to adjust the crop to your tastes.

![Cropping2](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping2.png)

#### 5\. Cropping controls

There are two options for cropping, you can use the Auto crop feature, which will detect any black lines and crop the footage between them, or if you are using the crop tool for something else, or just want to do it manually, you can set the crop via the left right top and bottom boxes. Values input here are the number of pixels from that edge the crop extends, as you are setting it, this is displayed with a green block signifying the area of the image that will be removed.

![Cropping controls1](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping-controls1.png)

You can adjust this independently for all 4 edges as you wish.

![Cropping controls2](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping-controls2.png)

Once you are happy with the crop, you click Ok and it takes you back to the familiar filter menu where you can use other components to perform more editing if you need.

#### 6\. Saving the crop

One of the most common points of confusion with Avidemux comes at this point, as your video will look no different to when you started, and many think they have done something wrong, but this is another part of Avidemux workflow. These filters can only be applied when the video is reencoded, and you do that through the file>save menu.

![Saving the crop1](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/saving-the-crop1.png)

Selecting this presents the familiar export dialogue and allows you to choose the name and destination of the file. Once that is done you click OK and you will see Avidemux processing your file and re-rendering it in this dialogue box.

![Saving the crop2](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/saving-the-crop2.png)

How long it takes will depend on a few factors, how many other effects have been added, how fast a processor your computer has, and how large and what resolution the video is. Format also plays a part in the process too, with some formats taking less time to encode than others. Once it has finished, you can view your video and see the crop in action.

As we can see, although there are a few aspects of the workflow that are a little unintuitive, cropping video in Avidemux is a straightforward process that anyone can accomplish with a bit of patience.

One of the key things to remember with Avidemux is that you apply all of your filters before re-encoding, this again is a question of patience and a bit of organization to ensure everything you wish to do is completed in order.

Avidemux is a great piece of software, it lacks the polish of some of its commercial rivals of course, but behind the sometimes clunky interface there is a very broad range of features that allow you to accomplish more or less any editing task you may want. In terms of free programs this is about as good as it gets, and the output is, without a doubt, great quality. For anyone looking for a free solution to video editing problems, and who do not mind a learning process Avidemux provides a useful tool.

Cropping a video, to bring focus onto the important aspects and remove the extraneous parts of the scene, is one of the most valuable tools available to a video editor. It can be used as mentioned to ensure the viewer focuses on what is important, but also to magnify objects on the screen, such as with footage of nature. It has many uses, and one of the best tools available for cropping video is the free program Avidemux. Here we are going to go through the process of getting Avidemux running on your system and cropping some video.

## How to Crop a Video with Avidemux

#### 1\. Installation

You can find [Avidemux for download here](http://fixounet.free.fr/avidemux/), it is available for a wide range of platforms, just download the version that fits your needs. Once downloaded, install in the standard way for your platform, this is the Wndows version (64bit).

One point of note during installation is that you can choose which parts of the program you wish to install. It is a very small footprint and for the best performance it is wise to simply install everything.

![Installation2](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/installation2.png)

Once installed you will be presented with the program as seen here.

![Installation3](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/installation3.png)

#### 2\. Importing Video

The next step is importing video. This can be done in two ways, by clicking the file folder icon at the top left you open a standard file browser to navigate to, and select your chosen video file, or alternatively you can simply drag you video into the main panel to import it.

![Importing Video1](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/importing-video1.png)

Whichever route you take, you will end up with your video file loaded in like this.

![Importing Video2](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/importing-video2.png)

Now you can edit the video as you need, Avidemux contains a wealth of features to enable the full spectrum of editing tasks to be completed. However, here we are going to look at the cropping tool, so on to the next step.

#### 3\. Editing Video

Avidemux has some idiosyncrasies in terms of operation, one of those is that to be able to edit any video, you have to choose your output format. Don’t worry though, this is easy, just use the dropdown at the side to choose the output format you want as can be seen here.

![Editing Video](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/editing-video.png)

Once that is set you are free to start editing your footage.

#### 4\. Cropping

It is important to understand how the editing process works in Avidemux, everything is accessed via the filters menu Video>Filters and from here you are faced with a new interface that enables you to choose the component you wish to use.

![Cropping1](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping.png)

Selecting ‘Crop’ from the menu and pressing the green plus symbol at the bottom activated the crop tool and presents you with yet another view that allows you to adjust the crop to your tastes.

![Cropping2](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping2.png)

#### 5\. Cropping controls

There are two options for cropping, you can use the Auto crop feature, which will detect any black lines and crop the footage between them, or if you are using the crop tool for something else, or just want to do it manually, you can set the crop via the left right top and bottom boxes. Values input here are the number of pixels from that edge the crop extends, as you are setting it, this is displayed with a green block signifying the area of the image that will be removed.

![Cropping controls1](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping-controls1.png)

You can adjust this independently for all 4 edges as you wish.

![Cropping controls2](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping-controls2.png)

Once you are happy with the crop, you click Ok and it takes you back to the familiar filter menu where you can use other components to perform more editing if you need.

#### 6\. Saving the crop

One of the most common points of confusion with Avidemux comes at this point, as your video will look no different to when you started, and many think they have done something wrong, but this is another part of Avidemux workflow. These filters can only be applied when the video is reencoded, and you do that through the file>save menu.

![Saving the crop1](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/saving-the-crop1.png)

Selecting this presents the familiar export dialogue and allows you to choose the name and destination of the file. Once that is done you click OK and you will see Avidemux processing your file and re-rendering it in this dialogue box.

![Saving the crop2](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/saving-the-crop2.png)

How long it takes will depend on a few factors, how many other effects have been added, how fast a processor your computer has, and how large and what resolution the video is. Format also plays a part in the process too, with some formats taking less time to encode than others. Once it has finished, you can view your video and see the crop in action.

As we can see, although there are a few aspects of the workflow that are a little unintuitive, cropping video in Avidemux is a straightforward process that anyone can accomplish with a bit of patience.

One of the key things to remember with Avidemux is that you apply all of your filters before re-encoding, this again is a question of patience and a bit of organization to ensure everything you wish to do is completed in order.

Avidemux is a great piece of software, it lacks the polish of some of its commercial rivals of course, but behind the sometimes clunky interface there is a very broad range of features that allow you to accomplish more or less any editing task you may want. In terms of free programs this is about as good as it gets, and the output is, without a doubt, great quality. For anyone looking for a free solution to video editing problems, and who do not mind a learning process Avidemux provides a useful tool.
