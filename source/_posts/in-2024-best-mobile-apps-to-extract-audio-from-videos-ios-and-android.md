You can convert MP4, m4v, amr, MPEG files formats among numerous others to MP3, FLAC, WAV, OGG, and other audio file formats.

#### 3. [Video to MP3 – Convert Audio](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/video-to-mp3-convert-audio/id1400653079)

#### 4. [MP3 Converter – Audio Extractor](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mp3-converter-audio-extractor/id1305099161)

**Price:**  Free, but offers in-app purchases

Converting a video saved on your phone’s camera roll to MP3 with the MP3 Converter – Audio Extractor requires you to just select a file and start the conversion process. You won’t even have to specify the output format, because MP3 is the app’s default output format. After the conversion, you can listen to the file you created to make sure that its quality is at a satisfying level. However, you won’t have any control over the bitrate of the output file or any other settings that can increase the quality of the MP3 you’re generating. Moreover, the app offers only modest file-sharing options, and you have to make an in-app purchase if you want to gain access to all features the MP3 Converter – Audio Extractor has to offer.
