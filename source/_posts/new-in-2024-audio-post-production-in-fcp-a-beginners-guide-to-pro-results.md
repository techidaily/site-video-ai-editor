## How to edit audio on FCP

There are 2 ways of editing audio of videos on FCP-clip-level audio editing and advanced audio editing.

#### Section 1 Clip-level audio editing

While dragging the audio or video clip onto the timeline you have surely seen the level line right above the clip waveform. One can just drag the level line and move it up or down for adjusting the dB of any given clip.

![ Clip-level audio editing ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-audio-in-fcp-1.png)

The job of the tiny white points on the right and left side of the clip is to apply the fade in and fade out effect on the audio. The left sided point can be dragged to the right to mark the ending of the fade-in effect of the clip. The right point has to be dragged left to set the start of the fade-out point.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-audio-in-fcp-2.png)

**Related Article:** [How to fade in/out audio in Final Cut Pro >>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Note:** In this level, any effects and adjustments in audio are applicable for the entire clip including the audio channels within it. All the adjustments in the individual audio channels made by you would be preserved by FCP. This implies that when one reduces the volume for just one channel but increases the volume of the entire clip, then the single channel’s volume is only raised in proportion to the volume of the other channels. Ideally, you should do your edits at the clip-level when you have only one or two audio channels on your video clip.

#### Section 2: Advanced Audio Editing

The audio of the video can be detached for editing the audio file separately. The Audio Inspector of FCP provides you with all precise controls of audio edit like pan, effect, volume, equalization and audio configuration.

![ The Audio Inspector ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-audio-in-fcp-3.png)

In order to detach the audio, you need to go to **Clip** \> **Detach Audio**. Or you can just right-click on the video file and click on Detach audio.

![ Detach audio ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-audio-in-fcp-4.png)

**Note:** There is a fine difference between ‘Detach Audio’ and ‘Expand Audio’. In Expand Audio, the audio clip is synced with the video. For instance, while moving the audio to the timeline, the video clip would also go with it. In case of detaching audio however the audio file would remain as a standalone clip that can be inserted into any portion of the video.

The Audio Inspector would allow you to apply the following effects:

* The volume can be increased by dragging the handle on the right side and lowered by dragging it towards the left.
* Audio Equalization would allow the user to apply various effects (bass, loudness, boost, etc.) on the audio clip. It can also be adjusted by using the in-built audio equalizer.

![ Audio Equalization ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-audio-in-fcp-5.png)

* Pan- Users can select from a number of Pan modes like surround sound or stereo. When you select ‘surround’, Final Cut Pro would provide you with a **Surround Panner** which would allow you to fine-tune the effects by moving the white point.

![Pan](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-audio-in-fcp-6.png)

* Effects- for this option one needs to go to the effects browser of the **Audio Inspector** or just hit comd5\. This would allow you to choose many different audio effects such as echo, distortion, spaces and much more. Just double-click on any effect to find a range of editing options.

![Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-audio-in-fcp-7.png)

* Audio Configuration: The audio configuration tool would allow the user to modify the audio channel with mono, stereo, or reverse stereo.

With more and more content being designed for phones, vertical videos are widely used now.

![Vertical Video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/resize-vertical-video-for-social-media-1.jpg)

If you too have recorded videos for posting on your social media sites, resize them in **vertical video ratio** and to get the right size, take help of a **video ratio calculator**.

#### In this article

01 [Benefits of Square and Vertical Videos](#Part 1)

02 [How Vertical Videos Are Displayed](#Part 2)

03 [What's the Best Tip to Resize Social Media Vertical Video Ratio?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 Benefits of Square and Vertical Videos

**●**   **What is Square Video & Vertical Video?**

A Square Video is the one that has the same width and height while a vertical video is taller than it is wide. A vertical video or a square video is presented in the form of a landscape. A square video has an aspect ratio of 1:1 while a vertical video has an aspect ratio of 9:16.So, in a vertical video, the **horizontal video size** is less than its vertical size.

**●**   **Why Vertical Video is Dominating**

It would not be wrong to say that the world has taken a mobile route and with this, the dominance of vertical videos can be seen. As per the studies it has been found that around 75% of the video playback across the globe are from mobile phones and around 94% of the time, the phones are held vertically. These figures completely state the need for the hour-vertical videos.

With users holding their mobile phones vertically the majority of the time, the dominance of the vertical videos is no surprise.

**●**   **Benefits of Square and Vertical Videos**

There are several benefits of having square and vertical videos. These videos are specifically

designed for mobile phones and thus they can be easily posted on multiple social media sites without any need for change or editing. Other benefits of using vertical videos are their ease of recording through a mobile phone. Vertical videos are beneficial even for the advertisers and promoters as they help them reach more audiences and prospective customers through social media sites and other sites.

## Part 2 How Vertical Videos Are Displayed

Vertical videos are majorly displayed on mobile devices as smartphones are used vertically most of the time. The width of these videos is less as compared to their height and this makes them appear fit on the smartphone’s screen. Moreover, using the s**creen aspect ratio calculator**, you can further decide upon the aspect ratio depending on the size of the device screen on which video has to be played.

## Part 3 What's the Best Tip to Resize social media Vertical Video Ratio?

Listed below are the tips for resizing the social media vertical video ratio.

**●** **Learn about the Aspect Ratios**

A vertical video is taller than it is wide. Thus, any video that is taller than the 1:1 aspect ratio will be termed a vertical video. The commonly used aspect ratio is 9:16 that uses the complete vertical screen. So, to capture a vertical video, use the camera in portrait mode or edit it as per the vertical aspect ratio. There are also **TV aspect ratio calculator** tools that can be used for the task.

![Learn About Aspect Ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/resize-vertical-video-for-social-media-2.jpg)

**●** Screen splitting

Multiple clips that are horizontal can be placed at the top of each other for a vertical frame as it is tall. The stacking can be done for the related clips or to make them appear as one. Place the clips creatively using patterns or lines.

![Screen Splitting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/resize-vertical-video-for-social-media-3.jpg)

**●** Filling the vertical space

If needed, you can creatively fill the vertical space when the shot is not a close one. One of the ideas is by raising the camera of your phone high and then moving it down that will give a deep frame. You can also fill up the vertical space below.

![Filling Vertical Space](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/resize-vertical-video-for-social-media-4.jpg)

**●** Side-to-side fast movements must be avoided

Since the width area in the vertical videos is less, it is also better to avoid the fast side-to-side movement as it will create a shaky and blurry effect.

![Avoid Side To Side Fast Movements](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/resize-vertical-video-for-social-media-5.jpg)

**●** Make use of text and graphics

To complement videos, using text and graphics is a good option. Use the vertical space smartly and include text, stickers, graphics, and other content for enhancing the video and its meaning.

![Use Text and Graphics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/resize-vertical-video-for-social-media-6.jpg)

**●** Grab attention

It is important for the videos on the social media sites to instantly catch the attention of the viewers, else they will move on to the next one. So, ensure that your vertical videos are eye-catchy and interesting with bright colors, looping animations, GIFs, and other content that is likely to hook up the viewers.

![Grab Attention](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/resize-vertical-video-for-social-media-7.jpg)

**●** Rule of Thirds

As per the photography rule of thirds, the main subject is not to be placed at the center and instead it the entire frame is divided into thirds using imaginary horizontal and vertical lines. The subject should be placed on these lines or where the lines meet. Use the guide grid on your phone’s camera to use this rule.

![Rule of Thirds](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/resize-vertical-video-for-social-media-8.jpg)

**●** Using a professional video editing software

## Part 3: What are the limitations when using Sony Vegas (Vegas Pro) on Mac?

Yes, with the given **Sony Vegas alternatives, Mac** and Windows users can benefit heavily. But why is it important to try for a replacement when Sony Vegas Pro is relatively efficient software?

To know the answer, you should take the time to understand its limitations, which do exist.

#### **It only works for Windows users**

The Sony Vegas Pro software is not available for Mac or other operating systems besides Windows. In addition, it’ll be really complex and time-consuming, even if you opt for virtual machine software or handle dual booting techniques to configure the software on your Mac or Linux.

#### **You need to invest in other hardware**

Sony Vegas Pro does do not work within one comprehensive platform like other capable video editing software types, like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You have to acquire a powerful PC and tools to operate it separately. The software works very slowly on older devices.

#### **Not incredibly unique**

The functions of Sony Vegas Pro match somewhat with other options in the market. So, users would not expect much value in purchasing this software’s plans that they want to upgrade from their previous system, but on the other hand, the available features are mostly standard-level in functionality as well.

## Hot FAQs about Vegas Pro Alternatives

After knowing these details, many users still have specific common queries about opting for a Sony Vegas Pro alternatively. So these are some common FAQs about this- answered.

#### 1\. Can Sony Vegas be used on a Mac?

No, it is impossible to directly use Sony Vegas on macOS devices since it does not support it. Instead, you have to separately use a dual boot strategy or virtual machine software to activate the video editor on Mac devices, but the process for that is complex.

#### 2\. Is Wondershare Filmora or Vegas Pro better?

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Vegas Pro are top-level options in video and audio editing projects with professional-level editing accuracy.

After knowing these details, many users still have specific common queries about opting for a Sony Vegas Pro alternatively. So these are some common FAQs about this- answered.

#### 1\. Can Sony Vegas be used on a Mac?

No, it is impossible to directly use Sony Vegas on macOS devices since it does not support it. Instead, you have to separately use a dual boot strategy or virtual machine software to activate the video editor on Mac devices, but the process for that is complex.

#### 2\. Is Wondershare Filmora or Vegas Pro better?

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Vegas Pro are top-level options in video and audio editing projects with professional-level editing accuracy. However, Filmora has a cohesive ecosystem with rich AI and standard functions and comes with Mac/Windows support. So, in that sense, Filmora is comparatively a better choice.
