#### 4. Blur face with Adobe Premiere Pro CC professional video editor

**Premiere Pro CC** is Adobe’s dedicated video editing software. There are many video editors out there that have some experience in Photoshop as well, and since there’s a chance they work in Premiere Pro CC due to how similar the UI of both of these products is, we’ve decided to give this NLE some attention as well. Available for both **MacOS** and **Windows**.

**How to Blur the Faces in Premiere Pro?**

1. **Select** the video clip in the timeline.
2. Access the **Effects** tab, and then click **Video Effects,** and then **Stylize**.
3. Click **Mosaic**.
4. Go to the **Effects Control** tab, and pick the shape of blurred area. The elliptical and 4-point polygon mask options are what most people use when blurring faces in particular.
5. Drag the **Mask** over the intended area
6. Adjust **Positioning**, **Scale**, **and**/**or Rotation** to your liking.
7. You can fine-tune the effect further by adjusting the **Mask Expansion,** the **Horizontal and Vertical** blocks the mosaic effect is composed of, and the **Feather**

What sort of video editing software you go for when you want to edit the face in videos is ultimately up to you - we’ve only expressed our personal preferences in the hopes that it might help some of the people that are interested in the subject. Most of the steps present in this list are similar to each other and you will find that once you learn how to do this trick, you will become far more familiarized with all the various effects available to you.

## Part 3 Top 5 Tips For Creating Effective Thumbnails

To make your thumbnails interesting and effective we have shortlisted a few useful tips as below.

**●** Keep it clutter-free: It's always good to keep your thumbnail simple and clean without any clutter. If you use too many elements in a thumbnail, they will look messy when watched on a mobile device.

**●** Using a still image from the video: Though you can set a customized thumbnail for your videos, an automatic image is also selected by YouTube. It might be a possibility that the image automatically selected is good enough and effective and thus creating a customized thumbnail is not required.

**●** Using editing software like [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for creating customized graphics: A good editing software can be used for creating an effective and impressive image. Wondershare Filmora is one such professional tool that can be considered. This Windows and Mac-based program can let you edit your images using multiple features. Simple and fast to use, the software also supports batch processing so that multiple files as thumbnails for multiple videos can be created at a time. Additional features supported by the software include motion tracking, adding text and tiles, adding overlays and filters, adding transitions and elements, color tuning, and more.

**●** Use eye-catchy titles: Using catchy titles in your thumbnails is an effective way to grab the attention of the viewers. A title will give a glimpse to the viewers of the content of the video.

**●** Try different designs: If you are not sure about a thumbnail design, create multiple ones and then add them to the video one by one. Select the design that goes best and looks attractive.
