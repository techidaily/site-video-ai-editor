## Vegas alternative for Windows

#### 1\. Adobe Premiere Elements - A Program like Sony Vegas

When a product is branded with Adobe, it means high quality, better performance, and consistency with another program by Adobe. [Adobe Premiere Elements](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-elements.html) is a **good Vegas alternative for Windows** (Mac version also available). Just as what's said on its homepage "the #1 consumer video editing software", Adobe is a popular video editor for home users.

For professionals, Adobe Premiere Pro is the better Sony Vegas alternative for Windows. It's the higher version of Premiere Element with differences in capturing, timeline editing, multiple sequence editing, DVD menu, surround sound mixing, etc.

#### 2\. ZS4 Video Editor - Free Alternative to Sony Vegas in Windows

[ZS4 Video Editor](http://www.zs4.net/news) is a free Sony Vegas alternative for Windows, Mac and Linux. It is the new incarnation of the free Zwei-Stein Video Editor. It comes with simple video editing tools and 150 video effects, but the interface is not so user-friendly. Compared to Wondershare [Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and [Adobe Premiere](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-elements.html), ZS4 Video Editor is not the common video editing software, but free is the most important factor for this Sony Vegas alternative.
