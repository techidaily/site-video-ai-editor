## Part 3: How to Make 2D Animation

A story ides is priceless. It is always important to build an essential story frame. Sometimes it is in a blink to have come up with an idea.

 **Step 2  Make a storyboard**

After all the ideas are fixed, you need to [make a storyboard for animation](https://www.bloopanimation.com/how-to-storyboard/).
