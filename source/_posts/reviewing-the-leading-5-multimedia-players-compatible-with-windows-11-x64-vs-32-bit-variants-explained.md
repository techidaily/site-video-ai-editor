★★★★★ Rating: 5.0 | OS: Windows, Mac & More | Type: Open source 

Starting from scratch VLC media player 64 bit is written in the 64 bit architecture of 64-bit Linux by its talented developers, and considering the fact that VLC's hardware acceleration utility supports 0-copy on GPU while enabling it to fallback on software when required, this media player x64 works fine with such advanced media codecs as UDP/RTP Unicast, UDP/RTP Multicast, HTTP / FTP, MMS, TCP/RTP Unicast, etc. While some users find [VLC 64 bit for Windows 10](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) a feature-rich upgrade worth considering, others reported troubling bugs like [VLC not playing DVD](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) or [VLC not playing MP4](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) problems.

**\[No.2\] Best Free 64-bit/32-bit Media Player for Windows 10 – 5KPlayer** 

★★★★★ Rating: 5.0 | OS: Windows, Mac | Type: Free 

The industry-leading [5KPlayer](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/) outshines any other 64-bit media players for Windows 10 thanks to its scientific computing kernel and cutting-edge graphic processing capability.

**\[NO.3\] Media Player Classic – Black Edition 64-bit Video Player for Windows 10**

★★★★☆ Rating: 4.5 | OS: Windows | Type: Free 

Very portable and lightweight, the 64 bit of MPC-Black Edition is another much-favored option, even better than the widely-known MPC-HC 64 bit. Unlike the all-you-can-eat VLC 64 bit, MPC-HC integrates all its salient features into a less-than-22 MB installer, thus applicable to even compact tablets & netbooks and Ultrabooks like Surface Pro.

Just like 5KPlayer, [Media Player Classic 64 bit for Windows 10](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) supports hardware acceleration in the video decoding process, which indeed facilitates the playback of ultra-hd videos. However, subtitle loading has long remained chronic headache of this media player 64-bit for Windows 10, and you'll need to pay special attention of [MPC-HC's MKV problems](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/).

**\[NO.4\] KMPlayer 64-bit for Windows 10** 

★★★★ Rating: 4.0 | OS: Windows & Mac | Type: Free 

As one of the big name media player 64-bit, KMPlayer for Windows 10 was bought by Pandora.tv back in 2008 while also making itself available for free. Indeed, this is a comprehensive x64 media player that supports a wide variety of container format such as VCD, DVD, AVI, MKV, Ogg as well as RealMedia, satisfying user demand if they have a media library containing media files of different container formats.
