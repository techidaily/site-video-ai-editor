A **MP3 player macOS Big Sur** is imperative if you've got plans for the latest Mac, or that you're not able to choose one among many MP3 players Catalina now that there are too many options, listed in APP Store or available for download. That being said, the top 4 best MP3 players for Mac (macOS Big Sur) on this page are genuinely free and handy, enabling you to play MP3 AAC FLAC music on Mac (macOS Big Sur/Mojave/High Sierra/Sierra/OS X) as if sitting in the front row of a concert.

Of all MP3 players Mac Big Sur we have tested yet, the free 5KPlayer is the most configurable and compact option. It is highly-integrated: Aside being a high-quality MP3 player for macOS Big Sur, it handles other advanced audio codecs without hassle, such as FLAC, CUE, OGG, AAC, etc without transcoding, thus preserving the original music quality from source to your ear.

There isn't an effective music achiving APP on Mac for long, and managing MP3 on macOS Big Sur via iTunes seems the last wannabe, thus calling for a reliable Mac MP3 player like 5KPlayer: featuring a clear-cut GUI, you may easily create a playlist, add, delete a MP3 file on Mac, or just click a heart icon to tag it as your favorite MP3.

**Enqueue - MP3 Player Big Sur for Audiophiles**

Paid MP3 players for macOS Big Sur is not in my budget, to be frank, but we still decide to recommend Enqueue as the only $9.99 macOS Big Sur MP3 player for audiophiles like you. 

Standing on the edge point of being compact, Enqueue is 8.7 MB only, working seamlessly on OS X 10.6 or newer. If you're quite used to iTunes' way of managing files, Enqueue MP3 player for Mac can't be a better alternative. The ability to play MP3 FLAC files on macOS Big Sur is pleasing many, yet Enqueue macOS Big Sur MP3 player won't read protected music files or smart playlists anyhow, which makes it a less compatible MP3 player macOS Big Sur when compared to [5KPlayer](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/).

![Enqueue](https://www.5kplayer.com/video-music-player/img/enqueue-mp3-player-macos-sierra.png)

 Very sensitive to macOS Big Sur MP3 library changes.  
 Smooth performance even with a large library of MP3 on Mac.
