Of all MP3 players Mac Big Sur we have tested yet, the free 5KPlayer is the most configurable and compact option.

**Enqueue - MP3 Player Big Sur for Audiophiles**

Paid MP3 players for macOS Big Sur is not in my budget, to be frank, but we still decide to recommend Enqueue as the only $9.99 macOS Big Sur MP3 player for audiophiles like you. 

Standing on the edge point of being compact, Enqueue is 8.7 MB only, working seamlessly on OS X 10.6 or newer. If you're quite used to iTunes' way of managing files, Enqueue MP3 player for Mac can't be a better alternative.
