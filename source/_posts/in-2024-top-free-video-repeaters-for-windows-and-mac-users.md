## Part 1: Best Video Loopers to Loop Videos for Free on Windows and Mac

Whatever you are motivated to create a video loop, you should know that it's a straightforward process. If you wish to create a looping video, you'll need to download a video editing tool. Here we will cover the best free video looper for you and how you can create a loop video.

### 1\. [Window Media Player](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-windows-media-player-81718e0d-cfce-25b1-aee3-94596b658287)

Windows Media Player offers a clean and intuitive interface, outstanding performance, particularly with big media libraries, and solid integration with Urge, the company's de facto music streaming service. Whenever Windows Media Player approaches the finish of a video, it gives you the option to repeat it manually, but it does not do it routinely.

Enabling the Repeat function, on the other hand, directs Media Player to play the video in a constant loop until you actively stop it or shut the software. Looping a video impacts the rest of the video from start to finish; Media Player does not only allow you to loop a portion of it but more.

**How to Loop Video in Windows Media Player?**

**Step 1:** Drag your mouse pointer over the Media Player window in **Now Playing** status to reveal the _playback settings_.

**Step 2:** To continually repeat the movie, click the **Turn Repeat On** button, denoted by a circular arrow, and glows blue when toggled on.

(**Note:** If you don't see this button in a tiny playing window, select the square **Maximize** symbol or drag the video corners to expand the window bigger).

**Step 3:** Until you exit the application or click the **Turn Repeat Off** icon, the Repeat option will repeat the whole video.

![play video in loop windows media player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-video-in-loop-windows-media-player.jpg)

 **Note:** When you close the window, your prior feature selection is retained; thus, the next video you watch will play in a loop until you turn off the **Repeat** feature.

### 2\. [QuickTime Player](https://support.apple.com/downloads/quicktime)

QuickTime Player is a basic application that allows you to watch videos and record screencasts on your Mac. You may also produce your videos and audio recordings and do rapid changes. Basic activities such as video flipping and clip splitting are included in edits.

You can record a screencast of a lecture, or capture a portion of the screen with QuickTime, which is ideal for creating a video lesson for an application. Using QuickTime, you may cut the length of video clips or merge many pieces into a single film. Drag the clips to a film window - QuickTime dynamically scales or trims them to fit the size of the movie.

It can also play your video on loop. Here's how:

It is not only a free video looper, but it also has several additional capabilities that allow you to create a full output with granular changes.

## Part 1: Best Video Loopers to Loop Videos for Free on Windows and Mac

Whatever you are motivated to create a video loop, you should know that it's a straightforward process. If you wish to create a looping video, you'll need to download a video editing tool. Here we will cover the best free video looper for you and how you can create a loop video.

### 1\. [Window Media Player](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-windows-media-player-81718e0d-cfce-25b1-aee3-94596b658287)

Windows Media Player offers a clean and intuitive interface, outstanding performance, particularly with big media libraries, and solid integration with Urge, the company's de facto music streaming service. Whenever Windows Media Player approaches the finish of a video, it gives you the option to repeat it manually, but it does not do it routinely.

Enabling the Repeat function, on the other hand, directs Media Player to play the video in a constant loop until you actively stop it or shut the software. Looping a video impacts the rest of the video from start to finish; Media Player does not only allow you to loop a portion of it but more.

**How to Loop Video in Windows Media Player?**

**Step 1:** Drag your mouse pointer over the Media Player window in **Now Playing** status to reveal the _playback settings_.

**Step 2:** To continually repeat the movie, click the **Turn Repeat On** button, denoted by a circular arrow, and glows blue when toggled on.

(**Note:** If you don't see this button in a tiny playing window, select the square **Maximize** symbol or drag the video corners to expand the window bigger).

**Step 3:** Until you exit the application or click the **Turn Repeat Off** icon, the Repeat option will repeat the whole video.

![play video in loop windows media player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-video-in-loop-windows-media-player.jpg)

 **Note:** When you close the window, your prior feature selection is retained; thus, the next video you watch will play in a loop until you turn off the **Repeat** feature.

### 2\. [QuickTime Player](https://support.apple.com/downloads/quicktime)

QuickTime Player is a basic application that allows you to watch videos and record screencasts on your Mac. You may also produce your videos and audio recordings and do rapid changes. Basic activities such as video flipping and clip splitting are included in edits.

You can record a screencast of a lecture, or capture a portion of the screen with QuickTime, which is ideal for creating a video lesson for an application. Using QuickTime, you may cut the length of video clips or merge many pieces into a single film. Drag the clips to a film window - QuickTime dynamically scales or trims them to fit the size of the movie.

It can also play your video on loop. Here's how:

**How to Loop Video with QuickTime Player?**

If you're using a Mac and wish to generate a video loop in QuickTime Player, follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Launch the **QuickTime** player to watch any video.

**Step 2**: In the taskbar at the top right of the screen, select **View**.

**Step 3:** From the drop-down option, select **Loop**. And that's it. You have put a video on loop.

![loop video quicktime player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/loop-video-quicktime-player.jpg)

These two video programs simplify setting up videos to run on repeat; they don't allow you to loop individual video parts. To do so, you'll need more powerful software, such as the well-known VLC Media Player.

### 3\. [VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/)

The VLC media player is a program that allows you to play video and music files on your computer. The VLC player can operate on several operating systems, including Windows 2021, XP, and Mac OS X, because of the device's powerful CPUs.

This makes the VLC Media Player an excellent alternative for anybody searching for a media player that can simultaneously run many programs. This free video editing program also includes special capabilities that allow it to execute numerous jobs simultaneously, including video editing, data transmission, graphic display, sound editing, and much more.

 **How to Loop a part of the Video in VLC Media Player Continuously?**

Create a beginning point A and an ending point B, which are in the center of VLC's timeline. There is a control button for the A to B looping function in the Advanced Controls. The starting and ending positions inside a media file can be specified by bringing up the advanced controls first. Now follow these steps to put a video on loop in the VLC media player:

**Step 1:** Open the video with VLC media player. Go to **View**. Select the **Advanced Controls** option.

![vlc media player advanced controls option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-media-player-advanced-controls-option.jpg)

**Step 2**: Go to the bottom of the VLC media player, and you will find 4 controls above the play button. Click the third button **Loop from Piont A to Point B continuously** to mark the starting point of the loop; and then click the third button again to mark the end of the loop.

![vlc media player loop part of video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-media-player-loop-part-of-video.jpg)

**Step 3:** Click the Play button and you will find the video is playing loop. Until you press the Loop from point A to point B option for the third time to discontinue the looped playback, the segment of the clip you've put up will keep on playing on loop.

### 4\. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/)

iMovie is a fantastic tool for making beautiful short films, music videos, picture slideshows, and other creative projects. You may also loop videos straight in the iMovie software; however, you'll need to utilize QuickTime to loop movies continually if you want to export them. Here are the quick and easy ways to loop a movie into iMovie.

**How to Loop Video in iMovie?**

**Step 1: Open** iMovie and then the video clip you want to loop in.

**Step 2**: Select the **Loop Playback** option from the **View** menu. Once the video begins to play, it will loop indefinitely until you stop it.

### 5\. [Windows Photos App](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-photos/9wzdncrfjbh4)

Microsoft Photos, a free photo viewer and editor bundled with Windows 10, provides capable image editing and photo improvements and capabilities for organizing and editing movies, all in a touch-friendly interface.

You may doodle on photographs, [apply background music](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and [3D effects to videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and use automated object tagging to make searching easier. Microsoft Photos is a wonderful tool for dealing with digital photographs, and for certain users, it may even replace third-party photo applications.

**How to Loop Video in Windows 10 Photos app?**

Windows 10 comes with the Photos app preinstalled. It can also assist you in making your movie loop. Here's how to do it.

**Step 1:** Import your video to the Photos app, and use the trim tool to get the part you want to loop.

![trim video windows 10 photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/trim-video-windows-10-photos.jpg)

**Step 2:** Copy and paste the trimmed video to the storyboard as many times as you like. And then click the Finish Video button to export the video.

![windows 10 photos finish video export](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-10-photos-finish-video-export.jpg)

## Part 2: Create Boomerang Loop with [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Looping a movie is not a difficult chore for anyone, even a novice. As we all know, most video players cease playing when a video approaches its climax. You can manually reverse the portion if you wish to see it with Boomerang effects.

You may loop and enjoy the video you like continuously when you do a new project in [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), a video editor for all video content creators.

**Step 1**: Launch the Filmora video editor and import the video file. Click on **File>Import Media>Import Media Files**. And then drag the video file to the timeline. Do some basic editing such as trimming and cutting to get the segments that you want to loop with the Boomerang effect, if necessary.

![cut video segment to loop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cut-video-segment-to-loop.jpg)

**Step 2**: Copy and paste the video file on the timeline, and then change the speed of the pasted video to apply the Reverse effect. Repeat the process to loop the video as many times as you want.

We have eight recommendations for you below that will allow you to pretty much do whatever you want (i.e., **convert FLAC to MP3**, convert **FLAC to ALAC**, **convert WAV to FLAC**, MP4 to FLAC, FLAC to MP4, M4A to FLAC, WAV to FLAC, and so much more.)

We've even included a handy general tutorial just after this to make sure that you're able to easily make use of your chosen **FLAC Converter**.

#### In this article

01 [How to Convert FLAC to MP3 (Fast & Brilliant Way)](#Part 1)

02 [8 Best Free FLAC to MP3 Converter](#Part 2)

## Part 1 **How to Convert FLAC to MP3 (Fast & Brilliant Way)**

As promised, we'll be starting this off with a general tutorial that you can refer to when using the converters that we've listed below! The tool that we will be using for this step-by-step breakdown is an online **FLAC Converter** called FreeConvert. We did not include it on our list just to make sure that you have the most options possible, but it definitely deserves a spot of its own, since it is a **free FLAC converter** as well.

### 01**Step 1: Open FLAC Converter!**

To start things off, you need to either launch (if it's software) or open (a.i., open the website for an online converter) your chosen **FLAC Converter**.

Once you've got your **FLAC Converter** all revved up. The first true step is the 'UPLOAD' step. This is when you use the upload features provided to prepare the FLAC audio that you want to convert.

For the tool we use for our example, you can do it in one of two ways:

**●** Upload Manually: Either from your device, from Dropbox, from Google Drive, or through a URL link.

**●** Drag-and-Drop: Simply drag and then drop the FLAC audio for conversion.

Here's a link to FreeConvert in case you wanted to try it out for yourself:

![Upload FLAC Audio File](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%201.png)

### 02**Step 2: Confirm Output Format!**

For our example, we'll be converting from **FLAC to MP3**. And so, when prompted to choose the desired output format, we choose "MP3"!

(Most converters will have multiple audio file formats and video file formats that you can convert to if you want to do something completely different — as is shown below):

![Confirm MP3 as Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%202.png)

### 03**Step 3: (Optional) Advanced Settings**

Before finishing up, you might want to explore the extra advanced settings offered by your chosen **FLAC Converter**! Each one will have different features.

FreeConvert, as an example, will allow you to adjust volume, add fade-in, add fade-out, reverse audio, and, even, trim audio before conversion! All you have to do to access these functions is to click the "SETTINGS" icon (pointed out in the image).

![Advance Settings Icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%203.png)

### 04**Step 4: Convert FLAC to MP3**

To initiate the actual conversion with FreeConvert, all you really need to do is click the 'Convert to MP3' button. Other **FLAC converter**s, while not the same, should be similar.

![Select Convert to MP3 Button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%204.png)

### 05**Step 5: Download Converted FLAC Audio!**

Finally, when the conversion has been completed, select the 'Download MP3' button to save your converted audio to your PC! That's it, you're done!

![Select Download MP3 Button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%205.png)

We have eight recommendations for you below that will allow you to pretty much do whatever you want (i.e., **convert FLAC to MP3**, convert **FLAC to ALAC**, **convert WAV to FLAC**, MP4 to FLAC, FLAC to MP4, M4A to FLAC, WAV to FLAC, and so much more.)

We've even included a handy general tutorial just after this to make sure that you're able to easily make use of your chosen **FLAC Converter**.

#### In this article

01 [How to Convert FLAC to MP3 (Fast & Brilliant Way)](#Part 1)

02 [8 Best Free FLAC to MP3 Converter](#Part 2)

## Part 1 **How to Convert FLAC to MP3 (Fast & Brilliant Way)**

As promised, we'll be starting this off with a general tutorial that you can refer to when using the converters that we've listed below! The tool that we will be using for this step-by-step breakdown is an online **FLAC Converter** called FreeConvert. We did not include it on our list just to make sure that you have the most options possible, but it definitely deserves a spot of its own, since it is a **free FLAC converter** as well.

### 01**Step 1: Open FLAC Converter!**

To start things off, you need to either launch (if it's software) or open (a.i., open the website for an online converter) your chosen **FLAC Converter**.

Once you've got your **FLAC Converter** all revved up. The first true step is the 'UPLOAD' step. This is when you use the upload features provided to prepare the FLAC audio that you want to convert.

For the tool we use for our example, you can do it in one of two ways:

**●** Upload Manually: Either from your device, from Dropbox, from Google Drive, or through a URL link.

**●** Drag-and-Drop: Simply drag and then drop the FLAC audio for conversion.

Here's a link to FreeConvert in case you wanted to try it out for yourself:

![Upload FLAC Audio File](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%201.png)

### 02**Step 2: Confirm Output Format!**

For our example, we'll be converting from **FLAC to MP3**. And so, when prompted to choose the desired output format, we choose "MP3"!

(Most converters will have multiple audio file formats and video file formats that you can convert to if you want to do something completely different — as is shown below):

![Confirm MP3 as Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%202.png)

### 03**Step 3: (Optional) Advanced Settings**

Before finishing up, you might want to explore the extra advanced settings offered by your chosen **FLAC Converter**! Each one will have different features.

FreeConvert, as an example, will allow you to adjust volume, add fade-in, add fade-out, reverse audio, and, even, trim audio before conversion! All you have to do to access these functions is to click the "SETTINGS" icon (pointed out in the image).

![Advance Settings Icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%203.png)

### 04**Step 4: Convert FLAC to MP3**

To initiate the actual conversion with FreeConvert, all you really need to do is click the 'Convert to MP3' button. Other **FLAC converter**s, while not the same, should be similar.

![Select Convert to MP3 Button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%204.png)

### 05**Step 5: Download Converted FLAC Audio!**

Finally, when the conversion has been completed, select the 'Download MP3' button to save your converted audio to your PC! That's it, you're done!
