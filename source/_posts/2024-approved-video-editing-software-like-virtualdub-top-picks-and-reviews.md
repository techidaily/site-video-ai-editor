To edit and enhance videos in Windows-based PC, Windows Movie Maker has always been touted as the default Microsoft Video Editor, although it has been discontinued by Microsoft on Janauary 10, 2017 and replaced by [Windows Story Remix (only for Windows 8/10)](https://www.howtogeek.com/355524/how-to-use-windows-10s-hidden-video-editor/), you can still download it on many platforms. However, you may often fail to import their video clips because it only supports WMV ASF, .MPG (MPEG-1), .AVI (DV-AVI), .WMA, .WAV, and .MP3\. Plus, the transitions and effects provided are quite limited, nothing fancy. If this is the case, you'll find a great microsoft video editing software here.

## Part 2\. How to Use Stop Motion Studio?

With the help of Stop Motion Studio, you can make animation by combining multiple pictures. You need to download Stop Motion Studio Pro for your iOS or Android device to use the app. You can also download it for PC.

![download stop motion studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/download-stop-motion-studio.jpg)

Step 1: Once you have downloaded the app, install it to work on your animation project right away. To create a new movie, click on the plus icon to create a new movie.

![adding new movie in stop motion studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/adding-new-movie-in-stop-motion-studio.jpg)

Step 2: Set the object you wish to capture in the frame. Let us consider one example where we will turn over an object. Click the camera icon to capture the shot. Move the thing a little and again tap on the shutter icon. Repeat the process until you have moved it all the way around. Once done, click on the play button. It will appear as if the object is in motion and moving on its own.

![changing frame rate on stop motion studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/changing-frame-rate-on-stop-motion-studio.jpg)

Tip: To ensure that your object is in the right place, you can use different controls like grid and onion skin. The grid will give you an idea of where you placed the subject in the frame. The onion skin puts the last frame you captured on top of your camera's live view. In this way, you can see how far you moved your subject between frames.

Step 3: You can click as many pictures as you need to convey your story. After clicking all the pictures, you can edit them as per your requirements. To increase or decrease the speed at which your video plays, change the frame rate by choosing the number of pictures to be shown per second when you play the video. Play the video to see how your work turned out. If you like the end result, exit the editor.

Step 4: Now select the animation that you just saved. Click on the export icon which you will find at the top left of the screen—select animated GIF from the pulldown menu. Export the file to Google drive, mail yourself or upload it on your social media profile. AirDrop the file to other iPhone users if you are an iPhone user.

![exporting file on stop motion studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/exporting-file-on-stop-motion-studio.jpg)

Step 5: You are done!! Yes, it was that simple and easy to create a great stop motion video yourself.

To increase or decrease the speed at which your video plays, change the frame rate by choosing the number of pictures to be shown per second when you play the video. Play the video to see how your work turned out. If you like the end result, exit the editor.

Step 4: Now select the animation that you just saved. Click on the export icon which you will find at the top left of the screen—select animated GIF from the pulldown menu. Export the file to Google drive, mail yourself or upload it on your social media profile. AirDrop the file to other iPhone users if you are an iPhone user.
