The process of combining multiple clips with this online tool can be completed in three simple steps, as you just have to upload the files you want to edit either from a hard drive or the cloud, rearrange them by dragging and dropping each video clip to a specific location on the timeline and choosing the format in which the file is going to be exported. You can opt to save the final cut of your video to your computer or to store it on Google Drive or Dropbox.

#### 3. [Aconvert](https://www.aconvert.com/video/merge/)

This app helps you to fix issues in the video footage that cannot be modified during the shoot time. The unexpected interruptions in the videos can be sorted out using the Final Cut Pro tool.

The stabilization feature helps to fix the shaky videos precisely. The Final Cut Pro application enables you to implement this feature in your footage easily. It is enough if you click the right controls to enable this option. This functionality is available to work on the shaky clipping on the video to acquire the desired results. To stabilize the shaky video with the Final Cut Pro app, you can follow the below instructions.

Step 1 You must import your video footage into the Final Cut Pro environment and add them to the working timeline.

Use the **add -> media file** option to include the video file into the Final Cut Pro ambience. Then, launch the ‘Video Inspector’ option.

Step 2 Enable the Stabilization check box to turn on this feature on the imported video.

In this module, you can find options to choose to fine-tune the stabilization attributes.

By default, the stabilization method is assigned to "**Automatic**". This function modifies the stabilizing factors on the shaky clippings. You can modify this method by dragging the sliders below.

There are two more methods available namely inertia Cam and Smooth Cam. In the Inertia Cam, you can work on the zoom options of the videos. The Smooth Cam allows you to perform translation, rotation, and alter the scale parameters to overcome the flaws in the videos.

Randomly move the pointers on the sliders and identify the best combination to overcome the distortion in the recorded video.
