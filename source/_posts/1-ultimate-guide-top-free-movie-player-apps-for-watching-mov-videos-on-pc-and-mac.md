![MOV Player](https://www.5kplayer.com/video-music-player/img/free-mov-5kplayer.jpg) 

**No.1 5KPlayer – Free MOV Video Player for Mac & Windows**

It's indeed the inherent [MOV player for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/), but QuickTime Player is not so satisfactory to play all MOV files as only MOV file encoded with MPEG-4 or H.264 video and AAC audio is supported by QuickTime.
