### What is .MOV and How to Play?

MOV format is a QuickTime media container format, developed by Apple Computer Inc. It is natively supported by such MOV file players as QuickTime Player. Yet despite all that, some MOV files cannot be played in QuickTime Player casually. MOV is a multimedia container format that can include one or more tracks, each of which stores a particular type of data: audio, video, effects, or text (e.g. for subtitles). Thus, MOV players such as QuickTime may have trouble to process all MOV files successfully.

Compared with Mac users, Windows users make MOV playing much harder. MOV isn't accepted by Windows Media Player, except for Windows Media Player 12\. If you believe that you only need to download Windows Media Player 12 for MOV playback on Windows, you are totally wrong. This is because Windows Media Player 12 is only available for Windows 7 and later. If you are working on older versions like Windows Vista, you are highly recommended to try another MOV video player like 5KPlayer.
