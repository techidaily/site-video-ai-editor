This could seem not to be a problem now as a sharp-eyed Reddit user had found that there is an interface upgrade of the widget that Apple Music service provides for artists to promote their music, and also allows users to log in to Apple Music accounts to [listen to Apple Music on computer](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/)directly. Why this Apple Music embeddable web player widget is added at the very moment before the launch of WWDC 2019? Maybe Apple has got Apple Music web browser prepared, and we hope the official Apple Music web player for all browsers on different platforms will be announced quickly.

When this Reddit user posts the update, it gets hot discussions. Most of the Apple Music users are very pleased to hear this and tell that they are looking forward to Apple Music web player for a long time.

_"This would be the best thing ever. I've been waiting for a web player forever and this shows that they at least have the functionality somewhat there." - butzsecs_ 
 _"Wow If this is legit I'm staying with apple music" - AquamarineHills_ 
 _"Wow really cool. I would love to have a web based iTunes like this as an option over fucking iTunes."_

If this Apple Music web browser widget would work on your computer, you can no longer be tied to the annoying iTunes and even uninstall it, or you may simply want to take a look at how to install [Apple Music for Windows 10](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/).
