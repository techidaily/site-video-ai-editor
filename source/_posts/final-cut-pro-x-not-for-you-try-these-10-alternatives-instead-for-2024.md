 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Back in 1999, Apple launched Final Cut Pro, and the software didn't take so long to become the first choice for video editors and post-production agencies.

The main feature it has that makes it stands out from any other video-editing software out there is that it is made exclusively to operate on Mac only, and that allowed Apple to make it fully enhanced for speed and efficiency enabling it to[**edit 4K**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) **UHD footage** with no rendering issues.

This video editing software will cost you $300 to buy, and as mentioned above it will require you to have a Mac OS, so if you don't have both or if you are a[beginner in video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) we are suggesting a few alternatives for you that you might choose one from to start your video editing journey.

## Best Free & Paid Final Cut Pro X Alternatives on Windows/ Mac/ Linux

### 2. Avidemux

Avidemux is a **free open-source and cross-platform** (Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X) video editor designed for quick video joining, trimming, and filtering tasks. It supports different video formats such as MP44, MPG, AVI, OGM, MKV, FLV, and more. Here is also a [getting-started tutorial for Avidemux](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you can refer to.

![free video joiner](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/avidemux.jpg)

**Pros as an alternative to FCPX for Windows:**

![free video joiner](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/virtualdub.jpg)

**Pros:**

* Has video capturing option;
* Can be extended with third-party video filters;
* Has batch-processing capabilities for processing large numbers of files.

**Cons:**

Outdated UI design.

### 4. Video Toolbox

Video Toolbox is a[free online video editing tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)that has a rich set of video functions. But like many online apps, it imposes a size restriction of 300 MB for your video files. To use it, you have to register first and upload the target files either from the hard disk or online video sites. Then fish the merging task use the command from a drop-down.

![free video joiner](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/video-toolbox.jpg)

* Different video editing options.

**Pros:**

* Basic video editing options.

**Cons:**

Can't convert audio files.

### 6. Movica

This software is, in essence, a user interface for other open-source tools that are somewhat user-unfriendly, enabling an understandable user interface for the best free tools out there. As a software package though, there is nothing wrong with this approach, and the tools available for joining and merging are first-rate, and the software works very fast, whilst offering a wide range of compatible video formats.

The interface is a little clunky, but it does the job and the software has additional tools for other editing work such as cutting and trimming as well, the added functionality in combination with a more basic interface can make some operations a touch confusing though.

![Movica](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/movica.jpg)

Ultimately a little more complicated to use, but very good.

### 02**How to Download Instagram Reels Audio Only?**

This one is a little more complicated — if you don't know how to find the direct URL link for Instagram Reels, but the process is actually much of the same, as we'll show you in the breakdown of the steps below:

**Step 1: Search for Audio**

The first step is to search for the audio that you're looking to download. For this, make sure that you select 'Audio' on the Search options!

![Instagram Search Options - Audio Selected](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-download-instagram-mp3-1.png)

**Step 2: Select Audio!**

**Step 3: Share Option!**

Once you've arrived on the audio page of your chosen track, select the share settings at the top right corner of the screen (pointed out in the image below.)

**Step 4: Copy Link & Download!**

At the bottom of the screen, you should now find an option to copy the direct URL link of the audio that you've chosen (as shown in the image below!)

Now, as mentioned in the previous section, all you need to do is take that link to an **insta mp3 converter**! The best of which we'll be introducing in the next section.

## Part 2 **The Best 6 Instagram to Mp3 Downloader Online**

Now, for the promised list of **Instagram Video Converter (MP3)** tools! This list will be as comprehensive as we can manage it, including not only an introduction but also the pricing, features, and limitations of all the converters in question.

### 01**INSTAGRAM VIDEO CONVERTER**

**Price**: FREE

The Instagram Video Converter offered on the 'Online Video Converter' website is the first **Insta MP3 converter** on this list! It's incredibly easy to use, and is free to boot!

### 02**Ace Thinker**

**Price**: FREE

Our next **Instagram Video Converter (MP3)** is Ace Thinker.

| Features                                                                       | Limits                                                                                          |

### 03**Instasaved**

**Price**: FREE

With our next pick, we spice it up with an Instagram-specific tool, called Instasave that you can use to download pretty much any kind of Instagram content that you want. That, of course, includes allowing you to **convert MP3 Instagram** posts! Note, however, this is not as well-known as other options out there, so use it mindfully!

| Features                                                                                                                         | Limits                                                                     |

### 04**OffMP3**

**Price**: Free

Next on our list is OFFMP3\. It is, much like the other tools we've introduced thus far, an online video converter tool! This one, however, just like Intasaved, is a lot more obscure than the first two that we introduced. And thus, a little more limited.

| Features                                                                  | Limits                                                                    |

![OffMP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-download-instagram-mp3-8.png)

### 05**4ins**

**Price**: FREE

Despite the name, 4in's Instagram to MP4 converter does work for converting Instagram posts into MP3 files as well (as is shown in the image below). It's not the most advanced converter tool out there. But it does work, and it requires no download or installation.

| Features                                                                                                                 | Limits                                                                  |
