Below are the best speech-to-text apps on Mac you might have missed since the beginning of 2022\. Some of the apps in the list are in-built into your device, while others may require you to download additional software. Regardless, all of those listed below are free to use on your Mac device. Keep reading to find out more.

## Part1: Top 1 Built-in Mac Dictation Feature

![top 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dragon-for-mac-1.jpg)

Did you know your Mac device comes with a built-in speech-to-text feature? So whether you use a laptop or desktop, you can generate text from your voice through your device's microphone. Officially known as Dictation, the app allows you to transcribe text anywhere you can type it. So, for example, you can use Apple Dictation for your messaging and word processing apps.

The feature has been available since macOS Sierra as a free built-in feature. Earlier versions of Apple Dictation relied on its voice recognition software. However, it now relies on Siri for users of macOS Catalina onwards.

Typically, the app allows you to transcribe thirty seconds and below of audio. However, you can enable Enhanced dictation for longer transcription times. According to most users, the app is suitable for getting the first draft of your assignment, which you can manually edit later.

Follow these steps to enable Apple Dictation on your Mac:

1. Tap the Apple logo on the top-left toolbar of your screen and select **System Preferences** from the resulting menu.
2. Click on the **Keyboard** option from the system preferences screen.
3. Once there, click on the **Dictation** option located at the top of the menu.
4. Select **On** to activate the app in its default mode. In addition, you can check the **Use Enhanced Dictation** box to enable additional functions such as offline use and text commands like bold and italics.
5. Finally, select your language from the dropdown menu and choose a shortcut key.

Please note that you need to speak your punctuation loudly when using Apple Dictation. Otherwise, the app will consider them as regular words.

## Part2: Top 2 Microsoft Word \[Free & No Download\]

![top 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dragon-for-mac-2.jpg)

Another option to consider is speech-to-text Microsoft Word Mac. The app is free to use and relies on Microsoft Azure Speech Services to transcribe text. Below are the requirements to use speech-to-text word mac.

* An external microphone for your Mac desktop, or you can use your built-in microphone for your MacBook. This is because speech-to-text on Microsoft word mac only allows input with a microphone rather than an audio file upload.
* An active Office 365 subscription. Please note you need to log in to your account for the app to function.
* Insider builds 16.32 (19120802) and above.
* An active internet connection.

Once you have everything set up, follow these steps to use speech-to-text on Word.

1. Launch Microsoft Word from your desktop.
2. Click on the **Dictate** button from the top menu of your Word document, and wait for the red dot to appear. The button features a microphone for easy identification.
3. Once the dot appears, start speaking to transcribe your text. Ensure you are in a quiet environment for the best results. In addition, speak louder when transcribing punctuations.
4. Click on the Dictate button to finish the transcription.

## Part3: Top 3 Google docs

![top 3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dragon-for-mac-3.jpg)

Google Docs is arguably the market's most accurate free speech-to-text service. In addition, it allows you to transcribe your voice to text and format documents with your voice. However, you can only use the service through the Chrome browser.

Follow these steps to activate Google Docs voice typing on your Mac device:

1. Launch the **Chrome** browser on your macOS and select **Docs** from the app menu. Please note you will need an active Google account to use the service.
2. Open a new document and click on the **Tools** tab from the top menu.
3. Select **Voice Typing** from the menu to access speech-to-text on Google Docs.
4. Tap the microphone to start transcribing, and tap it again to finish.

Google Docs speech-to-text is available in 71 languages. In addition, it supports simple commands such as 'create a bulleted list,' which are unavailable on other speech-to-text apps. As such, it is one of the market's most popular voice typing apps.

## Part5: Top 5 Dragon for Mac

![top 5](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dragon-for-mac-5.jpg)

In addition, dragon for Mac professional allows you to transcribe audio clips from uploaded files.

## Part6: FAQs

### Is there a difference between voice recognition and speech-to-text?

Voice recognition software allows your device to capture your accent and tone and then stores that data for different functions, such as user logins and speech-to-text functionality. For example, Siri will ask you to repeat a sentence several times as one of the setup steps.

### Which is the best external device for the speech-to-text service?

Most users report better speech-to-text accuracy when using headsets compared to using an external microphone. This is because the microphone is much closer to your mouth, so your voice is less affected by external noise.

### Can speech-to-text apps automatically translate a transcribed text?

Yes, they can. Apps such as Google's Speech to Text include a translation feature in their functionality. However, you will need the Google Chrome browser to access Speech to text. This is because the service is only available to active google account holders.

### How much faster is speech to text faster than typing?

A 2017 Stanford study states that speech to text is about [three times faster than typing](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3161187). In addition, it found that speech-to-text apps can transcribe over 150 words per minute, while professional transcriptionists range between 50 to 80 words per minute.

## Part 4: Top 5 Warp Stabilizer Tips and Troubleshooting

 **Premiere Pro stabilize** is a powerful tool, but it also carries some limitations. Let's check them out!

**1\. Consider warp stabilize during shooting:**

If you keep in mind the warp stabilizer function while filming your videos or photos, you'll get rid of fixing problems after the work. So, if you want glossy touch in your shots with zero access to a gimbal, you should consider filming with a faster shutter speed or a wider frame. In this way, you'll get more convenience while applying the effect in the edit.

**2\. Modify extra cropping in your footage:**

Warp stabilizer is a tool that can provide you stable footage and crop your shot as well. It can crop out the edges of your photos or videos, giving you a smooth and clean shot. To adjust the cropping in your clips, go to advanced settings and then click on Crop less <-> Smooth More Slider.

**3\. Analyze the effect of Warp stabilizer:**

Always check the order of effects in the ''Effect Controls'' folder. If you ever lost some stabilization after editing your shot, ensure not to change the Warp Stabilizer analysis source. Further, you should always re-analyze your clip after a quick color fix.

**4\. Nest your clips:**

Sometimes we got an error message in the form of a red banner across our footage while trying to modify the speed on **premiere stabilize video**. Basically, we can't use a Warp stabilizer to alter the speed of the same clip. But no worries! There is an easy fix – click on the altered clip and then click on Nest. Now, you can fix the nested sequence without any trouble.

**5\. Save your favorite settings as a preset:**

If you've found a setting that gives you a happy result, you can save it as a preset for future use. In this way, you can speed up your work nicely while working with numerous shaky clips. Also, it can help if you want to make a similar effect to your multiple projects. Moreover, keep in mind that the Warp stabilizer needs to assess each clip frame by frame because it is not a one-size model that can fit all footage. Therefore, remember to click the ''Analyze'' button even after putting the preset to turn it on.

## Part 5: How to Stabilize Shaky Footage Without Using Warp Stabilizer?

Sometimes, the shakiness of clips is too extreme, and the Warp Stabilizer effect can't handle it. Moreover, the filter algorithm incorrectly compensates for the camera moves. So what strategy should apply in this condition? Luckily, there is a method that can be used to stabilize your clips without using a warp stabilizer. Moreover, this process can give a hyper-realistic effect to your footage!

**Step1:** Import your clip into Premiere Pro Project and add it to your timeline. Hit on the "clip", choose "Replace with After Effects Composition" to import the clip.

**Step 2:** Tap on the ''Tracker panel'' from the right side of the screen. Scroll down to the ''Track Motion'' option and open it.

**Step 3:** Pick the tracker marker, drag it to an area of contrasting subject and adjust it accordingly.

![adobe premiere pro track motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-premiere-pro-track-motion.jpg)

Tip: Remember not to make the outer box too large as After Effects can have a hard time performing the track.

**Step 4:** Hit the play button in the ''Tracker panel'' to initiate the After Effects. Create a new ''Null Object'' after the tracking process is complete.

**Step 5:** Move to the Tracker panel, click on "Edit Target," choose your "Null Object" and click "OK."

**Step 6:** Create a new camera and parent it to the null object for applying the stabilization effect to your clips. Enable the 3D option on both the footage layer and the null object.

**Step 7:** Extend your footage to compensate for any black bars that can occur as the camera pays for the shakiness. That's it!

**Conclusion:**

Shaky footage is almost inescapable once you go handheld. If you don't have a manual stabilizer like a gimbal, a tripod, or a glide cam – your work can fall victim to running, wind, walking, or other elements. In this article, we've introduced a quick and fast antidote for shaky footage – a Warp Stabilizer effect in the Adobe Premiere Pro. It can smooth out your shaky photos or videos with just a few clicks. So, do you know how to **stabilize video premiere pro**? Read out the article!

## Part 4: Top 5 Warp Stabilizer Tips and Troubleshooting

 **Premiere Pro stabilize** is a powerful tool, but it also carries some limitations. Let's check them out!

**1\. Consider warp stabilize during shooting:**

If you keep in mind the warp stabilizer function while filming your videos or photos, you'll get rid of fixing problems after the work. So, if you want glossy touch in your shots with zero access to a gimbal, you should consider filming with a faster shutter speed or a wider frame. In this way, you'll get more convenience while applying the effect in the edit.

**2\. Modify extra cropping in your footage:**

Warp stabilizer is a tool that can provide you stable footage and crop your shot as well. It can crop out the edges of your photos or videos, giving you a smooth and clean shot. To adjust the cropping in your clips, go to advanced settings and then click on Crop less <-> Smooth More Slider.

**3\. Analyze the effect of Warp stabilizer:**

Always check the order of effects in the ''Effect Controls'' folder. If you ever lost some stabilization after editing your shot, ensure not to change the Warp Stabilizer analysis source. Further, you should always re-analyze your clip after a quick color fix.

**4\. Nest your clips:**

Sometimes we got an error message in the form of a red banner across our footage while trying to modify the speed on **premiere stabilize video**. Basically, we can't use a Warp stabilizer to alter the speed of the same clip. But no worries! There is an easy fix – click on the altered clip and then click on Nest. Now, you can fix the nested sequence without any trouble.

**5\. Save your favorite settings as a preset:**

If you've found a setting that gives you a happy result, you can save it as a preset for future use. In this way, you can speed up your work nicely while working with numerous shaky clips. Also, it can help if you want to make a similar effect to your multiple projects. Moreover, keep in mind that the Warp stabilizer needs to assess each clip frame by frame because it is not a one-size model that can fit all footage. Therefore, remember to click the ''Analyze'' button even after putting the preset to turn it on.

## Part 5: How to Stabilize Shaky Footage Without Using Warp Stabilizer?

**Step 4:** Hit the play button in the ''Tracker panel'' to initiate the After Effects. Create a new ''Null Object'' after the tracking process is complete.

**Step 5:** Move to the Tracker panel, click on "Edit Target," choose your "Null Object" and click "OK."

**Step 6:** Create a new camera and parent it to the null object for applying the stabilization effect to your clips. Enable the 3D option on both the footage layer and the null object.

**Step 7:** Extend your footage to compensate for any black bars that can occur as the camera pays for the shakiness. That's it!
