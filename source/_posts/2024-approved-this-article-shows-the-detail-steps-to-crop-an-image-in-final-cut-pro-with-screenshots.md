# Final Cut Pro X: How to Crop an Image

Cropping an image means to remove a portion of the image, either to hide something you don't want the audience to see or emphasize different elements within the image. Just as Photoshop allows us to crop still images, Final Cut Pro X allows us to crop moving video clips, as you'll learn in this article.

This is a basic tutorial about Apple Final Cut Pro X, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). This is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out. Download the free trial version below.

## How to Crop an Image in Final Cut Pro X

However, before I show how this is done, I need to explain one really important fact about video: all video uses what's called "fixed resolution." Fixed resolution means that high-definition video is always displayed at one of two sizes:

**You May Also Like:** [How to Crop GIF Images >>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

* 1920 x 1080 pixels
* 1920 x 1080 pixels

Unlike still images which can be thousands of pixels on a side, video clips are locked into one of these two sizes. This means that if you crop a video clip, to remove something you don't like, the remaining pixels are often enlarged to fill the frame. Crop too much and your video clip will look blurry, blocky, and edges will look stair-stepped.

I'll show you two ways to crop a video clip in this article, one that maintains a high image quality but reduces the size of the frame (called "trimming") and the other that fills the frame with the image but reduces image quality (called "cropping"). You get to pick which one works the best for you.

#### TRIMMING

Trimming is the process of removing portions of a video clip without changing the size of the clip. This retains the highest amount of image quality.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop001.jpg)

For instance, here an image - courtesy of Pond5 (<www.pond5.com>). Let's say that we want to emphasize the barn and not the sky.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop002.jpg)

The easiest way to do this is to click the icon in the lower left corner of the Viewer and choose "Crop."

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop003.jpg)

This displays the cropping tools in the Viewer.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop004.jpg)

Click the Trim button to turn on Trim mode. (This article discusses Trim and Crop. I'll cover the Ken Burns effect in a future article.)

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop005.jpg)

Grab one of the blue dots and drag to hide portions of the frame. I generally grab a corner, but any blue dot will do.

NOTE: Press and hold the Option key while dragging to drag opposite edges or corners. Press and hold the Shift key to constrain the trim to the same aspect ratio as the frame.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop006.jpg)

Drag other corners or edges to further trim the image.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop007.jpg)

When you have trimmed the image the way you want, click the "Done" button in the top right corner to exit trimming mode.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop008.jpg)

If no other clip is below the trimmed clip, the background will be black.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop009.jpg)

But, it actually isn't black, it's transparent. If you put another clip below it, you'll see the lower clip underneath the trimmed image.

Trimming allows us to hide portions of a video clip, without changing the image quality of the clip that remains. However, trimming always creates transparent sections within an image.

#### CROPPING

Cropping allows us to select just a portion of a video clip, without creating any transparent sections, BUT, it degrades image quality.

There are several ways we can choose to crop an image:

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop010.jpg)

* Click the Crop icon, as we illustrated above

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop011.jpg)

* Right-mouse click (or Control-click) inside the Viewer and choose
* Type Shift+C

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop012.jpg)

\* In the Inspector > Video tab > Crop (this option provides the most precision, but is the least intuitive to use)

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop013.jpg)

If you selected any option except the Inspector, click the Crop button in the Viewer.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop014.jpg)

Now, drag a blue button in one of the corners. Because cropping, unlike trimming, fills the frame with the portion of the image we select, we can only move corners and the image is always sized to match the aspect ratio of our sequence.

Final Cut displays numbers at the top of the Viewer indicating how much the image has been cropped.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop015.jpg)

Reposition the frame by grabbing inside the rectangle and dragging.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop016.jpg)

When you are happy with the results, click the Done button in the top right corner.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop017.jpg)

Notice that the selected portion of the image now fills the frame. Even though there is a clip below our cropped clip, we don't see it.

And, if you look closely, you'll see that the cropped image is softer (blurrier) than the original and edges are more likely to be stair-stepped.

#### RESET

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop018.jpg)

To reset a cropped image back to its default settings, open the Inspector and click the small curved arrow to the right of the word "Crop."

#### SUMMARY

Trimming is used to hide portions of an image and superimpose it over another image.

Cropping is used to reframe an image, say from a medium shot to a close-up, but runs the risk of overly softening an image. The general rule is that cropping a little is OK, but don't crop too much.

I use both these techniques frequently in my own editing.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop016.jpg)

When you are happy with the results, click the Done button in the top right corner.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop017.jpg)

Notice that the selected portion of the image now fills the frame. Even though there is a clip below our cropped clip, we don't see it.

And, if you look closely, you'll see that the cropped image is softer (blurrier) than the original and edges are more likely to be stair-stepped.

#### RESET

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop018.jpg)

To reset a cropped image back to its default settings, open the Inspector and click the small curved arrow to the right of the word "Crop."

#### SUMMARY

Trimming is used to hide portions of an image and superimpose it over another image.

Cropping is used to reframe an image, say from a medium shot to a close-up, but runs the risk of overly softening an image. The general rule is that cropping a little is OK, but don't crop too much.

I use both these techniques frequently in my own editing.

## Rotate Your Videos with Ease: Best Online Options

Wondering how you can **flip videos online**? There are numerous reasons why an individual may need to flip a video. It could be because the medium they are using to post a video requires a flipped version. There are times when we think we have recorded a video horizontally, but turns out it was recorded vertically - this is where video flipping software comes in handy and helps you out!

With this online video-editing tool, you can mirror a video from left to right or turn it upside down.

In this article, you can learn the key differences between flipping and mirroring a video, what are the best **flip video online free** tools, and how to flip a video using Filmora!

#### In this article

01 [Differences Between Flip and Mirror](#part1)

02 [Best Online Video Flippers](#part2)

03 [How to Flip Video with Filmora](#part3)

## Part 1: What’s the Difference Between Flip and Mirror?

Many people believe the flip feature and mirror function in a video editing tool is the same thing. However, that is not the case - there are numerous differences. The flip function allows individuals to vertically and horizontally change the outlook of a video. On the other hand, the mirror function allows one to make changes according to the mirror reflection.

![flip video source](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/flip-source-image.png)

Source Video

![flipped video ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filp-horizontally.jpg)

Video Flipped Horizontally

![mirrored video ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mirrored-image.png)

Mirrored Video

For instance, if a person is working from left to right - once the video is mirrored, it will show the person walking from right to left. So, the flip function changes the portrait and landscape layout of a video, while the mirror effect changes the axis.

Aspect ratios are critical elements in photography, although you don't have to go that deep! Still, you are here as you understand the significance of using aspect ratios in your projects and thus are looking to find the best **picture ratio calculator**.

![aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-do-you-find-the-picture-ratio-calculator-1.jpg)

In this guide, we'll talk about everything you need to know about the **photo ratio calculator**.

#### In this article

01 [What is Picture Size Ratio?](#Part 1)

02 [What is 1920x1080 in Ratio?](#Part 2)

03 [How Do You Find the Ratio of an Image?](#Part 3)

04 [1920x1080 Aspect Ratio and 16:9 Aspect Ratio Differences](#Part 4)

05 [The Resolution Calculator (image Ration Calculator)](#Part 5)

06 [A Practical Explanation about Aspect Ratios in Filmora](#Part 6)

## Part 1 What is Picture Size Ratio?

As already mentioned, a picture size ratio refers to calculating or determining the Ratio of an image. And, it's accomplished by using a**picture ratio** **calculator**. So, for example, the picture size ratio could vary from 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 16:9, etc.

You can visualize this aspect ratio by allocating an image's width and height units. For example, a 6×4 inch image has a 3:2 aspect ratio, whereas a 1920×1080 pixel video includes a 16:9 aspect ratio.

**Fact Check:**

An aspect ratio does not contain attached units—instead, it shows how large the width compared to the height, meaning that an image measured in centimeters will have the same aspect ratio even if measured in inches.

The relationship between its height and width decides the shape and Ratio instead of the image's actual size.

Different aspect ratios consist of varying effects on the image you use. For example, an image set in a 1:1 ratio vs. a 5:4 ratio changes the composition and perception of the photo.

**Types of picture size ratios**

**1:1 Ratio**

![1:1 aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-do-you-find-the-picture-ratio-calculator-2.jpg)

A 1:1 ratio includes an image's width and height are square and thus equal. Some standard 1:1 ratios are an 8″x8″ photo, a 1080 x 1080 pixel image generally used for mobile screens, print photographs, and social media platforms.

**3:2 Ratio**

![3:2 aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-do-you-find-the-picture-ratio-calculator-3.jpg)

The 3:2 Ratio is generally 35mm film and photography and is still extensively used for prints. Images framed at 6″x4″ or 1080×720 pixels set within this aspect ratio.

**5:4 Ratio**

![5:4 Ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-do-you-find-the-picture-ratio-calculator-4.jpg)

Last but not least, this Ratio is standard in photography and art prints and photography.

In the following sections, let's uncover more about the photo aspect ratio and its related calculator!

## Part 2 What is 1920x1080 in Ratio?

![1920x1080 in Ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-do-you-find-the-picture-ratio-calculator-5.jpg)

1920 x 1080 is itself a 16:9 aspect ratio. By default, DSLRs, smartphones, and most modern camcorders record video at 1920 x 1080.

## Part 3 How Do You Find the Ratio of an Image?

Before finding the image ratio, understand that there's a difference between image size and image ratio.

Unlike aspect ratios, image size shows the actual width and height in pixels. Image size refers to the image dimensions. You can measure its dimensions in any unit, but you'll generally see pixels used for digital or web images and inches used for print images.

It's essential to note that two different images containing the same aspect ratio may not have the exact dimensions of an image. For instance, the image has 1920×1080 pixels has 16:9 aspect ratios, and an image sized at 1280×720 pixels has a 16:9 aspect ratio.

You can use this[tool](https://calculateaspectratio.com/)to measure the aspect ratio of images. Here, match either ratio width and ratio and height or pixel width and pixel height to find the aspect ratio in this**image size ratio calculator**.

## Part 4 1920x1080 Aspect Ratio and 16:9 Aspect Ratio Differences

These are almost the same. The only difference is that of the pixels. If you cancel the numbers 1920 and 1080, they will automatically come as 16 and 9\. 1920 x 1080 is a 16:9 aspect ratio.

## Part 5 The Resolution Calculator (Image Ratio Calculator)

To use a picture aspect ratio calculator, you need to understand the following.

Understand the following five variables:

**●** H1 Height of the initial image

**●** W1 Width of the initial image

**●** H2 Height of the final image

**●** W2 Width of the final image

**●** A percentage - the proportion of the initial image's ratio to the final image's ratio.

The aspect ratio formulas that sync the quantities mentioned above for the ratio converter are:

06 [A Practical Explanation about Aspect Ratios in Filmora](#Part 6)

## Part 1 What is Picture Size Ratio?

As already mentioned, a picture size ratio refers to calculating or determining the Ratio of an image. And, it's accomplished by using a**picture ratio** **calculator**. So, for example, the picture size ratio could vary from 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 16:9, etc.

You can visualize this aspect ratio by allocating an image's width and height units. For example, a 6×4 inch image has a 3:2 aspect ratio, whereas a 1920×1080 pixel video includes a 16:9 aspect ratio.

**Fact Check:**

An aspect ratio does not contain attached units—instead, it shows how large the width compared to the height, meaning that an image measured in centimeters will have the same aspect ratio even if measured in inches.

The relationship between its height and width decides the shape and Ratio instead of the image's actual size.

Different aspect ratios consist of varying effects on the image you use. For example, an image set in a 1:1 ratio vs. a 5:4 ratio changes the composition and perception of the photo.

**Types of picture size ratios**

**1:1 Ratio**

![1:1 aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-do-you-find-the-picture-ratio-calculator-2.jpg)

A 1:1 ratio includes an image's width and height are square and thus equal. Some standard 1:1 ratios are an 8″x8″ photo, a 1080 x 1080 pixel image generally used for mobile screens, print photographs, and social media platforms.

**3:2 Ratio**

![3:2 aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-do-you-find-the-picture-ratio-calculator-3.jpg)

The 3:2 Ratio is generally 35mm film and photography and is still extensively used for prints. Images framed at 6″x4″ or 1080×720 pixels set within this aspect ratio.

**5:4 Ratio**

![5:4 Ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-do-you-find-the-picture-ratio-calculator-4.jpg)

Last but not least, this Ratio is standard in photography and art prints and photography.

In the following sections, let's uncover more about the photo aspect ratio and its related calculator!

## Part 2 What is 1920x1080 in Ratio?

![1920x1080 in Ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-do-you-find-the-picture-ratio-calculator-5.jpg)

1920 x 1080 is itself a 16:9 aspect ratio. By default, DSLRs, smartphones, and most modern camcorders record video at 1920 x 1080.

## Part 3 How Do You Find the Ratio of an Image?

Before finding the image ratio, understand that there's a difference between image size and image ratio.

Unlike aspect ratios, image size shows the actual width and height in pixels. Image size refers to the image dimensions. You can measure its dimensions in any unit, but you'll generally see pixels used for digital or web images and inches used for print images.

It's essential to note that two different images containing the same aspect ratio may not have the exact dimensions of an image. For instance, the image has 1920×1080 pixels has 16:9 aspect ratios, and an image sized at 1280×720 pixels has a 16:9 aspect ratio.

You can use this[tool](https://calculateaspectratio.com/)to measure the aspect ratio of images. Here, match either ratio width and ratio and height or pixel width and pixel height to find the aspect ratio in this**image size ratio calculator**.

## Part 4 1920x1080 Aspect Ratio and 16:9 Aspect Ratio Differences

These are almost the same. The only difference is that of the pixels. If you cancel the numbers 1920 and 1080, they will automatically come as 16 and 9\. 1920 x 1080 is a 16:9 aspect ratio.

## Part 5 The Resolution Calculator (Image Ratio Calculator)

To use a picture aspect ratio calculator, you need to understand the following.

Understand the following five variables:

**●** H1 Height of the initial image

**●** W1 Width of the initial image

**●** H2 Height of the final image

**●** W2 Width of the final image

**●** A percentage - the proportion of the initial image's ratio to the final image's ratio.

The aspect ratio formulas that sync the quantities mentioned above for the ratio converter are:

**H1/W1 = H2/W2,**

**H1 \* A% = H2, and**

**W1 \* A% = W2**

You are not required to understand the details by heart; if the initial resolution is generally used, use the list to select the ideal ratio:

**Proportions**

**●** 4:3,

**●** 3:2,

**●** 16:9,

**●** 16:10,

**●** 1:1, square, in some social networks,

**●** 85:1,

**Pixels**

**●** 2048:1536, iPad with Retina screen;
