## Part 2: Best Free Online Video Trimmer for Windows 10

Trimming the unnecessary parts of the video is the need of the hour. However, some people don't prefer downloading a tool for it. So, the following online video trimmers for windows 10 can assist them in their job:

### 2\. [Online Video Cutter](https://online-video-cutter.com/)

![online video cutter trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/online-video-cutter-trimmer.jpg)

Online Video Cutter allows you to trim easily, crop, and twist videos, as well as modify the playing speed. It functions in any browser — tested it in Safari on the Mac, which isn't frequently recognized by online tools, and it worked flawlessly – and the only restriction is that your file size cannot exceed 500MB.

You may export in MP4, MKV, or MOV format. It does not require any sign up from the user to trim the video and nor does it leave any watermark on the video after editing.

Features:

* Supports every kind of browser
* It does not leave any watermark
* Offers a quick no-encode alternative

### 3\. [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/)

![kapwing trim video online](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-trim-video-online.jpg)

Kapwing is a straightforward online video editor. It displays a preview of your video on the left side of the screen, and users can use the scales or timeouts to choose the start and finish times of their cut.

Kapwing is a premium service, which means free users can only upload files up to 250MB in size, and exports may only be 7 minutes long. There's no need to register yourself for editing the videos through Kapwing, but it does leave a watermark.

Features:

* Allows you to preview the video
* It is quite simple to use for editing
* It does not require any sign up before trimming

### 4\. [Adobe Creative Cloud Express](https://www.adobe.com/express/)

Adobe Creative Cloud Express is the best free online video trimmer windows 10 available for making simple modifications to videos. It enables the creation, editing, and sharing of new projects from any device. It recognizes original edit spots automatically and works with all AVI, MXF, and other file formats. Furthermore, the curve is managed automatically by this online video trimmer.

However, it needs registration to edit the video, and the free version leaves a watermark.

Features:

* It reformats the video automatically.
* It enables the editing platform to be expanded.
* It integrates with other apps and services without a hitch.

### 5\. [Clipchamp](https://clipchamp.com/en/)

![clipchamp trim video online windows chrome](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clipchamp-trim-video-online-windows-chrome.jpg)

Clipchamp is a freemium service, which means it has a free tier, but the finest features are only available to paying users. Your video output is restricted to general standards at 480p quality.

Since Safari does not support Clipchamp, you must use the Chrome or Edge browser on a Mac. Users need to register themselves for editing the videos through Clipchamp. The free version also leaves a watermark on the video.

Features:

* Helps the user to add audio and video
* Lets you export the video to social media platforms
* Offers multiple editing features for the video

### 6\. [Clideo](https://clideo.com/cut-video)

Clideo provides several online tools for looping, flipping, reversing, and filtering video clips, adding subtitles, resizing clips, and creating memes. Each tool is a standalone application running in your internet browser.

There are file size restrictions while using the free version, i.e., 500MB or fewer files, as with other online services. A Pro subscription, which costs $9 per month, allows you access to the full version. Clideo does not need registration, but the free version leaves a watermark.

Features:

* Excellent editing features in the free version
* Helps you add subtitles to the video
* Allows you to compress/resize the video
