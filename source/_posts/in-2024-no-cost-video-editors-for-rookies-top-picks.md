## What are the common problems people often face when they cut and join videos?

[![cut and join video clips](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/video-editor/troubleshooting.jpg)](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/video-editor/troubleshooting.jpg)

Often, instead of solving your problem, the choice of a wrong tool can cause you much more headaches, such as:

* The poor-designed user interface, the tool is very difficult to use
* Only supports running on limited Windows OS such as Windows 7, not applicable for Windows 8 and Windows 10, no Mac version
* It takes an eternity for two videos clips to be merged
* Very few video formats supported/ only videos with the same formats can be merged
* Only videos with the same aspect ratio can be merged
* Poor quality on the output/resulting file, serious loss of quality from the sourcing files
* Painful to export to multiple devices

In light of those above-mentioned reasons, it is wise for you to identify the following points before you move forward with your endeavor:

* The operation system of your computer, a Windows 7, or Windows8, Mac OS 10.10?
* The formats of your source video clips, .mp4, .avi, .flv, or any other popular formats?
* To what device you are planning to export your resulting file to/play your resulting file on?
