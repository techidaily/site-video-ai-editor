Microsoft has released **Windows Live Movie Maker** on August 19, 2009 as part of a refresh to their Windows Live Essentials download. Windows Live Movie Maker is the first application designed for Windows 7 and is built to make beautiful movies from your photos and videos. And the latest version is **Windows Live Movie Maker 2011**.

**Update in 2017:** Microsoft has stopped the Windows Essentials Suite support on January 10, 2017\. It is claimed that it is no longer available for download. If you are looking for an alternative to windows essentials movie maker, or windows movie maker, try Filmora video editor, which is available on both Windows7, Windows8 and Windows 10.

Windows Live Movie Maker is a little bit limiting for video editing. In most cases, you need to run Windows 7\. Fortunately, you do have other options. There is plenty of software which will do the same thing but better than Windows Live Movie Maker for you to [edit your videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and burn videos to DVD.

Secondly, it provides powerful video editing function, such as crop, trim, adjust video effect, add watermark, etc. Also, there are various title and text templates, filter/transition and effects presets for you to choose from. Thirdly, Windows Live Movie Maker can only generate WMV files directly, but this video editor supports burn video to DVD disc, DVD Folder and ISO file or save the video to most of the popular formats.

## Must-Try Apple Video Editing Tools for Professionals

Apple is widely known for its iPhone, iPad, and Macitonsh computer around the world, but do you know that it also provides some fantastic video editing software for creators? In this article, we've compiled a list of the best **Apple** **video** **editing** software on the market right now, including free, freemium, and premium solutions.

With these apps, you can modify videos on your smartphones or computers easily. And if you've invested in an iPhone 13 Pro or iPhone 13 Pro Max that can capture video in the high-resolution ProRes standard, you'll find reliable software to make the most of your video. We'll go over which applications are excellent for specific chores and provide statistics to help you discover the best match. Let's get started!

## Apple Apps for Video Editing You Should Try

In today's world, photos and videos are an integral part of everyone's life. Mobile phones, laptops, and cameras may all be used to capture them. But, it might not be easy to organize and decorate them according to one's unique preferences. Fortunately, there are several tools available to help Apple users with these tasks.

In the following part, I will introduce 5 best apple video editing software, including its unique features listed.

### 1\. Photos

**Supported By:** iOS/macOS/iPadOS

**Pricing:** Free to use

The number one on our list is the Photos app. It's among the most well-known application for video editing enthusiasts in the iOS community. This is an application mostly used by professional designers and developers who are into the video editing profession.

**What Can You Do with Photos App?**

Apple Inc. created Photos, a picture storage and editing program. Its main features are its simplicity and ease of usage. Its very name is a lovely and obvious indication of its use. Since 2015, this Mac picture editing app has been offered for OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 and tvOS v.10.

Filters and Smart Sliders are among the editing tools available in this program. It also has the Mark-up tool that allows you to **add text**, shapes, and doodles, as well as signatures. What’s more, you can **rotate, crop and auto enhance** videos in this app as well. Like photos editing, if you are not satisfied with the editing, you can tap **Revert** to restore to the original version.

If you are using the Photos app on iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro, you can **adjust the focus points and the depth of the field** in Cinematic mode to make a cinematic-looking video easily.

* **Edit Videos Anywhere with iCloud Photo Library**

The connection with iCloud Picture Library is where Photos outperforms every other Mac image editing tool. This fantastic feature allows users to fill out their libraries rather than their devices. This is accomplished by syncing photographs and videos across all Apple devices, including the iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, MacBook and Apple Watch.

* **Moments**
