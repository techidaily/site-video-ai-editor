What is Apple TV Plus? Apple TV+ is the brand-new video streaming service that Apple released in November 2019 to offer consumers a way to subscribe to other online TV services, and more importantly, to subscribe to its own original TV and movie programming. With one Apple ID and password, you can enjoy a wide range of contents on multiple devices without need to switch from app to app, from dramas and comedies to kids shows and documentaries.

What is Disney Plus? Like Netflix and Apple TV+, Disney+ is also an American subscription video on-demand service that focuses on film and television contents from Walt Disney Studios and Walt Disney Television, ranging from TV shows and movies to documentaries and shorts. Also, it will include legacy contents from Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, National Geographic and 20th Century Fox.
