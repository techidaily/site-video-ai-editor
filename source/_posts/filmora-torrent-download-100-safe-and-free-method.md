## Part 1  Risks of Using Illegal Filmora Torrent You Should Know

Well, there are some drawbacks and multiple threats that your PC will have to face when you download Wondershare Filmora Torrent. Some of the disadvantages and drawbacks are listed below.

### 1\.  Lack of Assistance

One of the significant setbacks of using illegal means to get Filmora is that you will not receive any technical assistance from the developer because you have not genuinely purchased the software. Moreover, if an issue occurred in your version of Filmora, you cannot even report it and get technical assistance to fix it permanently.

### 2\.  Illegal

Using an application or software that you have not genuinely purchased is a crime everywhere. However, its punishment may vary depending on the countries or regions.

### 3\.  Lack of Updates

Getting Wondershare Filmora through Torrent will block all the communication with its server. Due to this, neither will you get the notifications about the updates, nor will you be able to update your application. In a nutshell, you will get stuck with the installed version of Filmora, which will get old with time.

### 41\.  Lagging

Downloading the Filmora X torrent means you're getting a crack version, which can never match the integrity and speed of the actual version itself. Since the software's code is modified not to need an activation key to unlock all the features, the software will experience lagging whenever you use it.

### 3\.  Virus

Getting software through illegal means comes with many setbacks, and the virus is one of them. The modified copy of Filmora is not as secure as the original one. For cracking the software, they modify the .exe file, making it vulnerable to multiple threats and viruses that can harm your PC.

## Part 2  New Features of Filmora You Should Try in 2022

You cannot simply neglect Wondershare Filmora when you are talking about software for video editing that comes with brand-new editing features. Filmora is among the top-rated video editing software. It comes with many helpful features for editing videos in multiple formats. Some of its notable features are:

### 1\.  AI Portrait

AI Portrait is one of the brand-new additions in Wondershare Filmora. It allows you to [remove the background of videos without using a Chroma key and green screen effect](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You can also add glitch effects, noise, pixelated borders, segmentation video effects, and many more using AI Portrait on Wondershare Filmora.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

This feature helps you change the settings of effects and customize it according to your needs. For example, if we are talking about the noise, you can change the Percentage, Edge Thickness, Edge Feather, and Alpha with the help of this tool.

This add-on works perfectly for single and real objects facing the camera. Fast movements, backlight, and multi-person portraits influence the output of the AI portrait. However, you need to purchase this feature to add it to the Wondershare Filmora.

![Filmora remove and change video background ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-new-video-background.jpg)

### 2\.  Auto-Reframe

Powered by AI technology, this feature detects the focal point of the video automatically. Auto Reframe allows you to always keep the main object or action of the video in the frame. You can manually change the focal point of the video or opt for an aspect ratio that meets your requirements with the help of Auto Reframe.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

This feature also helps you select the focal point depending on the platform you want to share your video on. It allows you to adjust the video's speed (i.e., Auto, Slow, or Fast). You can also preview the video in real-time while reframing it.

For auto reframing the video, you need to import the media and then select auto-reframe from the Tools. After selecting the aspect ratio and adjusting the speed, analyze the video and export it in the required format.

![Filmora auto reframe feature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-auto-reframe-feature.jpg)

### 3\.  AR Stickers

Wondershare Filmora features a wide collection of AR stickers that you can use to emphasize reactions, enhance emotions, and add personality to the video. The face-tracking stickers are image-based filters with fun and attractive elements such as bears, koalas, pandas, cats, glasses, bunnies, and many more. For instance, applying the AR sticker named Heart eyes will automatically add hearts to the person's eyes and start moving with them.

AR stickers work great when tried on an object facing the camera. However, if more than one object is in the frame, the stickers will attach to any face it detects. Moreover, adding AR stickers is no complicated job. You can add them the same way as other filters. You can also delete the applied AR sticker if it looks dull or doesn't fit with your video by right-clicking on it and then selecting **Delete Effect**. However, by selecting delete effects, you will remove all the applied effects, i.e., other than AR stickers.

## Brightness and Contrast Video Editors Compared

Do you face these kinds of issues a lot while you're shooting through your phone? Although you may make a video at any time using your iPhone or Android smartphone, you are much more likely to face a dull environment that you cannot adjust at the time. Filming in low light may result in a video that is too dark to see clearly and may potentially degrade video quality.

In such cases, employing a video brightness program on your smartphone or Windows computer might be one of the finest ways to brighten a video. Hence, we've compiled a list of some excellent **Video Brightness Editor** tools for you on this page. Read ahead to learn more about their brightness settings and other options.

#### In this article

01 [Best Online Video Editors to Adjust Video Brightness](#part1)

02 [Best Desktop Video Editors to Adjust Video Brightness](#part2)

## Part 1: Best Online Video Editors to Adjust Video Brightness

There are software and internet resources that can assist you in resolving this issue. You may brighten your movies without exerting any effort if you use the correct video brightener application or website. Read about some of this software when you want to learn more about brightening videos.

### **1\.** [**Veed.io**](https://www.veed.io/)

Is it too dark to watch your visuals? There is "light" at the end of the tunnel, so don't panic. You may alter the brightness, contrast, color distribution, backdrop, transparency, and more in your movie using Veed.io color, vibrancy, and flare may be added to your videos.

Alternatively, for a dramatic impact, lower it a little! Our expert brightness editor will bring out the finest in your video, no matter what it is. Launch your preferred web browser, such as Chrome, Opera, or Mozilla Firefox.

To brighten your videos, upload your video to VEED's video editor. Select 'Adjust' after clicking the video track. From left to right, move the Brightness key.

### 2\. [**Kapwing**](https://www.kapwing.com/)

Another video brightener is Kapwing Video Editor, which brightens videos online without requiring any installations. There is a choice to enter a video URL to add light to the video when utilizing the following online effects to illuminate the video-sharing site.

You may also edit and brighten video by uploading it from your computer's hard disk. There are various more video-related tools available on the internet that assist you in beautifying films for social media posting.

Most of the functionality found in the other social network video editors on our list are available, including video templates, ways to resize and cut your video clips, text tools, and even some basic geometric shapes.

You may also convert, trim, resize, and loop videos with at least 15 video tools, many of which are incorporated with the main Studio software. You may perform everything for free and without any hassle. The subtitle tool, for example, is a fantastic tool that allows users to upload subtitles to the industry standard.SRT file.

### 3\. [**Clipchamp**](https://clipchamp.com/en/)

The first semi-professional video editor on this roster is Clipchamp. Clipchamp includes video templates for just about any scenario you can think of. The program also provides videos in a range of aspect ratios. There's also a good selection of stock audio and video.

### 4\. [**Clideo**](https://clideo.com/)

Clideo is a cute website that can be used to brighten up dreary films. This website allows you to modify video brightness for free, and you may use it without installing something on your computer. The site is free, but there are certain limits, so you'll need to upgrade to the premium version to use all of the features. Because it is online and operates straight in the browser, you may use it to adjust the brightness of your Windows 7 computer.

All you have to do now is upload the video from your computer that you wish to modify. You may upload up to 500 MBs in the free version. You'll find modification settings on the right when your movie has been uploaded. To lighten your video, drag the Brightness slider to the right. After you've made the necessary edits, you may save the movie to your computer.

## Part 2: Best Desktop Video Editors to Adjust Video Brightness

It's difficult to constantly record a video in great light, so you attempt to brighten a dark movie or modify the brightness of a video to make it appear better for sharing.

As a result, many people want to know which desktop video editors are the best for adjusting video brightness. Learn about the applications that can assist you in this endeavor by reading on.

### **1\.** [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Wondershare Filmora is an excellent choice when you need to get started with simple video editing features while also having the possibility to progress. If you're concerned about dark videos, Filmora can comfortably solve the issue. Click on the Import option and choose the file of your liking. Then apply changes from the adjustment settings to make it look worthwhile!

For macOS 10.12 or later

Filmora video editor allows you to adjust the brightness with the auto enhance feature in one-click. What’s more, it provides the color match feature which allows you to match the color between different clips.

### **2\.** VSDC Free Video Editor

The VSDC Free Footage Editor, in the hands of a skilled user, can generate some truly professional-looking videos. The application supports virtually all major video formats and includes complex video effects such as object transformation and color correction, and also advanced audio effects such as volume adjustment and sound normalization. You have the luxury of brightening your videos simply by uploading the video from your desktop and making whatever changes that you want to make.

VSDC Free Video Editor is actually free, unlike certain "high-end" editors. You may utilize the whole feature set of the application without having to contend with annoying watermarks. Unfortunately, there is one snag. You must pay if you want technical assistance. (And there's a strong possibility you'll have to.) Subscription for the VSDC Free Video Editor is $1 per month, $5 per half-year, and $10 per year.

### **3\.** iMovie

iMovie for Mac allows you to experience your films in new ways. Make Hollywood-style teasers and gorgeous movies in excellent 4K resolution by quickly browsing your footage and instantly sharing your best moments. Color Balance and Color Correction are two options for brightening a movie in iMovie 10.1 or later. The former has four tabs: Auto, Match Color, White Balance, and Skin Tone Balance, which allow you to make automated color adjustments.

The latter has sliders for manually adjusting brightness, contrast, saturation, shadows, and other parameters. Simply choose the clip you want to change and then select the appropriate tool from the toolbar above the viewer. It's not very technical, but it makes it simple to brighten up a gloomy video.

### 4\. **Premiere** Pro CC

Premiere Pro includes a user interface that is both appealing and versatile. The startup feature enables you to rapidly return to previous projects, start new ones, or browse for Adobe Stock video. You can switch between workspaces for Assembly, Editing, Color, Effects, Audio, and Titles, and the dark system window tends to make your videos the focus of attention.
