## Part 4 Why are Prime Movies, not Full Screen?

Are you facing the issue that Amazon Prime Video widescreen is not fully supported, or prime movies are not full screen? Well, there can be some reasons or problems due to which this happens. Such as Prime Video playing in Smart TV, Phone of Mi TV not appearing widescreen to have a better view or sometimes outline bars appear that makes the visible area quite less. What to do to solve the issue or if there exists some solution? Let's take a look over some of the reasons due to which Amazon Prime Video widescreen does not appear as required:

**●** Some of the devices do not support particular resolution videos.

**●** In some devices under the settings, there comes an app scaling option to make Amazon Prime Video widescreen. However, this is not the official way to do so, though it works many times. But, this option varies from system to system.

**●** This often occurs when the dimension of the device screen mismatch with that of the video aspect ratio. Since a 16:9 aspect ratio or 1920X1080 pixel resolution is required for a Full HD video, device dimension varies, say 2400X1080 pixels. Now, if you want to see your video in a 1:1 ratio, then around 240 pixel wide black bars will appear on either side of the video if kept in landscape mode.

Alternatively, if you try to zoom in on the video, black bars will disappear, resulting in cropping the video visuals from the side.

A possible solution can be using some [video editor software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) support to adjust the screen resolution or aspect ratio of the video as per the requirement of the device. For this purpose, one can refer to Wondershare Filmora video editor. That can be the perfect solution to this problem.

## Part 3: How to Create a Stop Motion Videos with Life Lapse

 You don’t have to be a skilled cinematographer to make a stop motion video using the Life Lapse app. Once you’ve installed and launched Life Lapse you should create a new project by tapping on the + icon.

 The app also grants you access to a broad range of tools that will make composing the shots easier or reduce the flickering effect. Even though Life Lapse doesn’t limit the maximum duration of the stop motion videos you can create with it, an Instagram story cannot be longer than 15 seconds. Furthermore, changing a video’s aspect ratio to 9:16 is recommended, as it will enable you to know exactly how your stop motion video is going to look like after you upload it to Instagram.

## Part 4: Tips for Creating Stop Motion Videos for Instagram

 The process of making a stop motion animation is not technically complicated since you just need to place your phone on a [tripod](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and take a photo each time you move an object in the shot. Even so, working on a stop motion project requires previous preparations. Here are a few tips that will help you make a better stop motion animation video.

### 1\. Develop a concept

 What is your stop motion video about? This is the first and the most important question you will have to answer before you start making a stop motion video. Developing a concept will enable you to know which props you are going to need or how many actors you have to find before you can actually start shooting. Stop motion videos can be virtually about anything, and you should choose a story that will keep the audience interested from start to finish.

### 2\. Shoot in studio conditions

 Although it is not impossible to make a stop motion video in outdoor conditions, having control over sudden light changes is. That is why it is much better to shoot stop motion videos in studio-like conditions where you can easily adjust all the parameters in accordance with the demands of the project you’re working on. In addition, it is paramount to keep your phone perfectly steady, which is why it is better to mount it on a tripod than to shoot handheld.

**Conclusion**

 Instagram’s stop motion feature is still under development and it may be some time before you can use it to create professional-looking videos. Apps like Over or Life Lapse are a much better option for all video content creators who would like to impress their audience with stop motion videos. Which app are you using to create stop motion videos? Leave a comment and let us know.

 The process of making a stop motion animation is not technically complicated since you just need to place your phone on a [tripod](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and take a photo each time you move an object in the shot. Even so, working on a stop motion project requires previous preparations. Here are a few tips that will help you make a better stop motion animation video.

### 1\. Develop a concept

 What is your stop motion video about? This is the first and the most important question you will have to answer before you start making a stop motion video. Developing a concept will enable you to know which props you are going to need or how many actors you have to find before you can actually start shooting. Stop motion videos can be virtually about anything, and you should choose a story that will keep the audience interested from start to finish.

### 2\. Shoot in studio conditions

 Although it is not impossible to make a stop motion video in outdoor conditions, having control over sudden light changes is. That is why it is much better to shoot stop motion videos in studio-like conditions where you can easily adjust all the parameters in accordance with the demands of the project you’re working on. In addition, it is paramount to keep your phone perfectly steady, which is why it is better to mount it on a tripod than to shoot handheld.

**Conclusion**

 Instagram’s stop motion feature is still under development and it may be some time before you can use it to create professional-looking videos. Apps like Over or Life Lapse are a much better option for all video content creators who would like to impress their audience with stop motion videos. Which app are you using to create stop motion videos? Leave a comment and let us know.

 Even though Instagram’s new stop motion feature offers an easy way to make your stories more interesting, it still has a few downsides.

### Frequently Asked Questions: Why Can’t I See the Stop Motion Feature in Instagram Stories?

 Instagram’s stop motion feature is still in its beta stage, which means that it isn’t available on all versions of the app. So, if you can’t see this option you must go to Google Play or Apps Store and install the version of Instagram that has this feature. If the issue persists, you should opt for some other stop motion app you can use free of charge. ;

## Part 2: 3 Best Stop Motion Apps you can Use to Create Animated Videos for Instagram

 You shouldn’t worry if the stop motion feature isn’t available on the version of Instagram you’re using, because there are so many apps that are equipped with this tool. With so many different options on the market, finding the app that provides you with all features you need to create stop motion videos can be a difficult task.

### 1\. [Over](https://www.madewithover.com/)

However, the free version of the app offers only limited capabilities, and you must upgrade to the Pro version if you want to have access to all photo and video editing tools Over have to offer.

### 2\. Mojo

**Price:** Free, offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/mojo-create-video-stories/id1434861974), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=video.mojo)

There are more than a hundred animated templates to choose from, so after you pick one, you just have to [add text overlays](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), but you must purchase Mojo Pro if you want to [change aspect ratios](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), duplicate stories or have access to all text styles and templates.

![Life Lapse Stop Motion Maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/life-lapse-stop-motion-camera.jpg)

Besides capturing photos and videos, the app also allows you to import photos you want to include in the stop motion animation.

![the-best-fcpx-tutorial-fcp-co](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-6.jpg)

FCP.co is dedicated to all things video on the Mac, focusing on Final Cut Pro X video editing techniques and lessons.

![the-best-fcpx-tutorial-apple-support-center](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-7.jpg)

On Apple's official website, the FCPX support community is active. If you have a specific query regarding the application, this is an excellent resource. The emphasis here is less on editing style, and skill since most content focuses on more technical FCPX software/hardware concerns. It's worth mentioning that if you contribute to the community by assisting other users with their problems rather than just asking questions, your editing karma will skyrocket!

### 3.[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/finalcutpro/)

## Part3: Is Paid Class of FCPX Worth For Beginners?

The last thing you want to do with your hectic schedule is sitting through hours of aimless video lessons. Buying Final Cut Pro lessons gives you the feel of having a personal trainer working alongside you. You can enroll in FCPX paid courses on Udemy and Coursera. Often a certificate of completion is available for download at the end of the course.

However, if you are a beginner, we won't recommend you buy paid courses. There is unlimited free content related to Final Cut Pro available on YouTube and other websites that you can access without spending a penny.

When you have to spend too much money and energy on an editing tool, consider if it's really worth it. Rather, you can always choose a much easier yet still powerful editor like Filmora to save your time for better editing.

FCPX.tv, with its motto "all things Final Cut Pro X," is a one-stop shop for the most up-to-date advice and news on this software. An endless list of Final Cut Pro X requests (for future versions and upgrades), FCPX editing lessons, and documentation of known FCPX issues are just a few of the highlights. If you're an FCPX power editor, this is a must-visit website.

## Part3: Is Paid Class of FCPX Worth For Beginners?

The last thing you want to do with your hectic schedule is sitting through hours of aimless video lessons. Buying Final Cut Pro lessons gives you the feel of having a personal trainer working alongside you. You can enroll in FCPX paid courses on Udemy and Coursera. Often a certificate of completion is available for download at the end of the course.

However, if you are a beginner, we won't recommend you buy paid courses. There is unlimited free content related to Final Cut Pro available on YouTube and other websites that you can access without spending a penny.

When you have to spend too much money and energy on an editing tool, consider if it's really worth it. Rather, you can always choose a much easier yet still powerful editor like Filmora to save your time for better editing.

Your budget will not always be sufficient, and you will frequently find yourselves at a fork in the road when the funds are few. So, the good news for FCPX editors is that there is a slew of free plugins, including overlays, LUTs, flares, and titles, that are very excellent (and don't seem like your dingus friend produced them). You can watch the tutorial course if you want to learn more about these free and paid plugins in all price ranges.

Are you new to Final Cut Pro X and don't know where to start? If you're new to FCPX and want to get started with video editing, you can join this FREE hour-long in-depth training that will get you up and running in no time!

![the-best-fcpx-tutorial-totally-exposed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-5.jpg)

When you're learning from a seasoned expert, it's easy to feel left behind as they go through tools and features you've never heard of. On the other hand, the Totally Exposed channel puts such concerns to rest with one-of-a-kind lessons in which we learn with Neil, a novice who has never used FCP X before.

Importing, basic terminologies, cutting clips, and adding music, as well as adding effects, titles, and exporting the finished material, are all covered in this video. It's more of a trawling movie than a fast instruction at over one hour long. However, it's ideal for novice users who want to take things a little more slowly and absorb knowledge over time.

**Why recommend this channle?**

• Extensive yet still very well-paced for beginners.

• Amazing teaching skills.

However, all the video tutorials are quite long because FCPX is powerful but not easy to get started with. You can always choose Wondershare Filmora to boost your editing.

## Part2: **The Best Websites to Read about Final Cut Pro Basics**

If you are looking for the best websites to learn Final Cut Pro basics, then you can visit the following web pages:

![the-best-fcpx-tutorial-fcp-co](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-6.jpg)

FCP.co is dedicated to all things video on the Mac, focusing on Final Cut Pro X video editing techniques and lessons. They're continuously updated on the latest FCPX third-party plugins and filters (including many free effects). Unlike Apple's FCPX user forum, this one is quite active and updated frequently.

![the-best-fcpx-tutorial-apple-support-center](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-7.jpg)

On Apple's official website, the FCPX support community is active. If you have a specific query regarding the application, this is an excellent resource. The emphasis here is less on editing style, and skill since most content focuses on more technical FCPX software/hardware concerns. It's worth mentioning that if you contribute to the community by assisting other users with their problems rather than just asking questions, your editing karma will skyrocket!

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Stop motion videos have been growing in popularity over the course of the last few years because they easily capture a viewer’s attention. Only a few decades ago this animation technique was used solely by movie industry professionals, but today you no longer have to be a seasoned animator in order to create stop motion video.

In fact, you don’t even need desktop-based [video editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), because there are so many different web-based video editing platforms that offer all the tools you need to make a captivating stop motion video. That is why in this article we are going to take you through some of the best online stop motion makers. So, let’s get started.

## Part 1: Top 5 Online Stop Motion Makers You Should Try

Whether or not you already have the footage you intend to include in a stop motion animation is probably the best way to determine which platform you should choose. Furthermore, the number of images or video clips you want to upload to an online stop motion maker can impact the amount of time you are going to need to complete a project.

### 2\. [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/tools/stop-motion)

**Price:** Free, $20 for a monthly subscription

![ kapwing stop motion maker interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-stop-motion-maker.jpg)

Kapwing offers a broad range of tools that enable you [to resize videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), add audio to them or even add subtitles and captions to videos. So it is hardly a surprise that you can also use Kapwing to create stop motion videos.

After you upload a video clip from your computer or a URL you can set the speed at which frames are going to be displayed and pick the rate at which frames are going to be taken from the video. When done you should simply click on the Create button and wait for the platform to generate a stop motion video.

You can then decide if you want to share the video on social media or download it to your computer. Keep in mind that the videos created while you weren’t signed in to your Kapwing account are going to be watermarked.

**Pros**

* Simple stop motion creation process
* Excellent file sharing options
* Offers an inexpensive way to create stop motion videos
* No previous video editing experience required

**Cons**

![ Clideo stop motion maker interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clideo-online-stop-motion-maker.jpg)

Creating a stop motion video with Clideo won’t take much more than a few minutes of your time, regardless of the format in which the source video is saved. After you upload the footage from which you want to create a stop motion video to the platform, you just have to set the speed at which frames are going to be displayed and the frequency at which [frames are going to be extracted](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) from the source footage.

Optionally you can click on the Append Reversed Video checkbox if you want to play the stop motion video backward. Clideo also lets you choose the format of the output video, which enables you to export videos WebM, MP4, MOV and numerous other file formats. When done adjusting the settings, simply click on the Slow Motion button and then download a video to your computer.

**Pros**

* Supports a broad range of video file formats

**Price:** Free

![ Stop Motion Animator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stop-motion-animator-chrome-extension.jpg)

This is a simple add-on for Google Chrome that enables you to use a computer’s webcam to create stop motion videos. This tool only offers basic options, which means that you can snap photos, adjust their [playback speed](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), erase them or record audio.

However, Stop Motion Animator is far from being a perfect choice for video content creators as it can only be used with a webcam. In addition, this extension for Google Chrome is prone to crashes, which is why it is important to save your project regularly. The most recent version of Stop Motion Animator allows users to upload images although you shouldn’t expect great results.

**Pros**

* No payment required prior to installation
* Equipped with audio recording tools
* Enables users to upload their own footage
* Videos are saved in WebM format

Anyone can create stop motion animations with this web-based app, even if they don’t have any previous video editing experience. However, before you can start creating using Cloud Stop Motion you must first create an account and grant the app access to your computer’s webcam. Afterward, you just have to start a new project and start snapping pictures.

Each image you take will be displayed on the timeline so that you can have a clear overview of all photos that are going to be included in the stop motion video. Cloud Stop Motion lets you record audio and import audio files from its sound library or your computer. The platform also features a selection of opening titles, [end credits](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), speech bubbles and text overlays that can be added to the timeline with a single click.

**Pros**

* Modernly designed interface
* Equipped with a rich audio library
* All projects can be saved
* Available on tablets, Smartphones, Chromebooks, desktop and laptop computers

**Cons**

* You can only create 500 MB of footage with the free version of Cloud Stop Motion

## Part 3: How to Make Stop Motion Videos from Videos Online

In case you don’t have the photos you can use to create a stop motion animation, platforms like Kapwing allow you to turn a regular video into a stop motion video.

![ kapwing stop motion maker interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-stop-motion-maker.jpg)

While adjusting these settings you should keep in mind that lowering a [video’s frame rate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) too much can result in choppy footage and uneven movement of the objects in the stop motion video you’re creating.

Kapwing also offers the option to [play the video in reverse](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), but finding the right context to use this feature can prove to be a challenging task. Click on the Create button when ready to export the stop motion video and wait for the platform to generate the video.

![ kapwing stop motion maker export & share](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-stop-motion-maker-export.jpg)

Afterward, you can choose to download, edit or share the video on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter.

## Part 3: How to Make Stop Motion Videos from Videos Online

In case you don’t have the photos you can use to create a stop motion animation, platforms like Kapwing allow you to turn a regular video into a stop motion video. All you need to do is upload a video clip from your computer or via a URL to Kapwing and the platform will automatically generate a stop motion video. One of the best part is that Kapwing also provides a sample if you don’t want to upload your own footage.

![    Import footage to Kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-stop-motion-footage-in-kapwing.jpg)

![ kapwing stop motion maker interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-stop-motion-maker.jpg)

While adjusting these settings you should keep in mind that lowering a [video’s frame rate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) too much can result in choppy footage and uneven movement of the objects in the stop motion video you’re creating.

Kapwing also offers the option to [play the video in reverse](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), but finding the right context to use this feature can prove to be a challenging task. Click on the Create button when ready to export the stop motion video and wait for the platform to generate the video.

![ kapwing stop motion maker export & share](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-stop-motion-maker-export.jpg)
