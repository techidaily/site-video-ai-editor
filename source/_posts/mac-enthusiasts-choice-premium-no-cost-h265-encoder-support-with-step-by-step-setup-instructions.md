HEVC is a high video compression standard supporting larger frame sizes, high-res 4K/8K and HDR10 metadata for High Dynamic Range videos. HEVC/H.265 videos contain equal quality but half sizes compared to AVC/H.264 videos.

So, to play a highly-compressed HEVC/H.265 video on Mac, a professional **HEVC player for Mac** is needed when QuickTime is not competent to handle this kind of video format.

_"So I upgraded my Mac to high Sierra and I was about the H.265 video encoding standard but when I encode a H.264 video to H.265 standard and then when I attempt to open the video using quick time player it shows 'Quick Time player does not support these kinds of videos.'" – from Apple Community_
