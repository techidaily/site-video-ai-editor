HEVC is a high video compression standard supporting larger frame sizes, high-res 4K/8K and HDR10 metadata for High Dynamic Range videos. HEVC/H.265 videos contain equal quality but half sizes compared to AVC/H.264 videos.

So, to play a highly-compressed HEVC/H.265 video on Mac, a professional **HEVC player for Mac** is needed when QuickTime is not competent to handle this kind of video format.

_"So I upgraded my Mac to high Sierra and I was about the H.265 video encoding standard but when I encode a H.264 video to H.265 standard and then when I attempt to open the video using quick time player it shows 'Quick Time player does not support these kinds of videos.'" – from Apple Community_

Some people said that anything running macOS 10.13 can playback HEVC as long as it's a QuickTime container format .mov but not a MPEG-4 container format .mp4\. While others claimed that when the tag is "hvc1" and it's a MP4 container with aac audio, QuickTime can also play HEVC on Mac successfully. It seems that Apple has set some restrictions to QuickTime for H.265/HEVC playback, so that you have to satisfy such requirements or [download HEVC/H.265 codec for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) to beef up the QuickTime player.

Therefore, here we gather 3 best Mac HEVC players to help you play HEVC/H.265 4K 1080p HD videos on Mac without hassle.
