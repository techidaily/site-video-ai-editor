### VLC Player Windows 10 Problems and New Features

Alongside VLC Windows 10 (64bit & 32bit), there are plenty of giant media labels launching their Windows 10 compatible versions in a row, let's take a look at how the videolan.org's contributors have made VLC an ace in a hole.

Listed below are VLC video player Windows 10 new features from Microsoft Regional Director and [VLC Media Player](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/) developer Jean-Baptiste Kempf: 

#### **★ VLC Player Windows 10 Version New Features:**

**1.** New User Interface: VLC player Windows 10 put on a revamped new UI to match Windows 10 style, with various WM10 UI fixes, and the _Title Bar now transparent_.   
 This time when you click "minimize" on the bottom right, it switches to a VLC mini audio player, a smart solution on Windows 10 when you want to play music and tackle other tasks simultaneously.

**6.** VLC Windows 10 Controls and Settings, see details here: _https://www.vlchelp.com/controls-settings-vlc-app-windows-10/_

#### **★ VLC Media Player for Windows 10 Problems:**

1\. **VLC Resume Playback not Working After Windows 10 Creators Update:** Users who upgraded to latest Windows 10 Creators Update instead of following a clean install have higher chances of running into this VLC Windows 10 resume playback not working problem. This is because the system upgrade assistant usually reset program defaults when migrating to a newer version of OS. To resolve this, you need to uninstall & reinstall VLC for Windows 10 again.

2\. **VLC Can't Play DVD:** Despite an overhaul for DVD and CD support, VLC Windows 10 still can't remove problems like [VLC can't play DVD](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/). If you watch DVD videos (encrypted DVDs) quite often, then VLC player Windows 10 may be a less wanted choice. Alternatively, you may find [5KPlayer](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/) a smart and free widget to play DVD on Windows 10\. It bolsters a wide catalogue of DVDs (VOB/VIDEO\_TS/ISO), bypassing Disney DRM, CSS, Sony ARccOS, RCE, or any region codes.

3\. **VLC Audio Delay:** Another unexpected bug is audio and video out of sync in VLC Windows 10\. Most frequent delays happen when you use VLC Windows 10 to play a 4K, H.264 H.265 video on a lower-end Windows 10 PC. Indeed you may turn to tutorials on [how to fix VLC audio delay](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/), where you'll be advised to use Audio De-synchronization Compensation, or install MKVToolNix to automatically adjust the synchronization problem. To make things easier, 5KPlayer has an easy-to-operate sync bar when you right click on it, which doesn't run into similar VLC audio delay problems.

4\. **VLC Crashes Windows 10 with Multi-line Subtitles:** Subtitles with multiple lines may cause VLC player Windows 10 to crash. though this time support for embedded SSA subtitles is included, a precise debug would be required to enhance VLC player stability on Windows 10 PC, Surface, and Windows Phone. 

5\. **VLC Windows 10 Can't Control Play Speed Settings:** Even if you're an old friend of VLC media player, you might go nuts when trying to control play speed settings in VLC Windows Store. That being said, this media player rely largely on some shortcuts to complete some advanced settings, which may require extra efforts. 

User Reviews @ www.microsoft.com - VLC Windows 10 - Ambitious but Broken

_\---" I like what VLC Windows 10 is trying to be, but, in it's current state, it is an absolute mess._ 
_It randomly decides whether it will play FLAC (even though it says it can). Searching for or navigating to an artist is only doable by scrolling from the top._ 
_Pressing any button causes the app to crash."_
