## Transform Your Videos: Top MP4 to MP3 Conversion Tools

# MP4 2 MP3: Best MP4 to MP3 Converters

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

##### Ollie Mattison

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

The MP4 file format is probably the most commonly used video file format today, as various video recording devices use it as the default video file format. The duration of a video and the resolution in which a video was captured determine its size, so the size of an MP4 file can vary between a couple of hundred of megabytes to a couple of gigabytes. That’s why there is no reason to store huge MP4 files if you only need their audio since converting this type of file to an MP3 file format is a simple process. Read on if you would like to learn more about the best MP4 to MP3 converters you can use online or on PC and Mac computers.

## Best Mac and PC-based MP4 to MP3 Converters

Both Mac and PC users have a broad range of free software products at their disposal that enable them to convert MP4 video file to MP3 audio files. So, let's take a look at some of the easiest ways to turn MP4 to MP3 on a Mac or a PC.

### 1\. Using Filmora to Convert MP4 to MP3 Files

Filmora is a powerful video editing software that is compatible with both macOS and Windows operating systems. Besides offering a plethora of video editing tools you can use to create green-screen videos, stabilize shaky footage captured with action cameras or make the Picture-in-Picture effect, Filmora also lets you edit audio files with ease. The built-in library of royalty-free music and audio effects enables you to create compelling soundtracks for each of your videos, while its Denoise feature helps you reduce background noise in audio files. Converting an MP4 to MP3 in Filmora is a quick process that won’t take much longer than a couple of minutes. Here’s how you can convert an MP4 to MP3 with Filmora.

![Filmora9 Export MP4 as MP3 ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-mp3-9-win.jpg)

After you’ve created a new project, you should head over to the editor’s **Media Panel** to import the MP4 video file you’d like to turn into an MP3 audio file. The file you imported into a project in Filmora will be displayed in the Media Panel and you should simply **drag and drop it to the timeline**. After you’ve placed the MP4 file to the video track on the timeline, you should click on **the Export button**.

The Export window will appear on the screen and you just have to **select MP3 as the preferred output format** and click on the **Export button**. The rendering process will start immediately, but its duration depends on the size and the quality settings you’ve chosen. Filmora lets you create high-quality MP3 audio files from MP4 video files which makes it a great choice for a broad range of users.

## Part 1 The Only Guide You'll Ever Need to Learn about YouTube to MP4 Video Converter

### 01**What is the MP4 format?**

![mp4 format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/solution-for-choosing-fast-youtube-to-mp4-video-converter-02.jpg)

MP4 files were executed under the ISO/IEC 14496-12:2001 standard by the IEC/ISO and Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG). MP4 is an international specification for audio-visual coding only because of this.

The high degree of compression used in MP4 videos assists the files to be much smaller in size than other video formats. Minimizing the file size doesn't suddenly affect the file quality, either. Almost the entire original quality retains, making MP4 a web-friendly and portable video format.

They shouldn't be confused with M4A and MP3, while MP4 files can play audio.

It can also help to store the other kinds of data files, such as different subtitles and still images.

This media container allows a blend of video, audio, subtitles, and still images to be present only in a single file. It also assists in storing advanced content like 3D Graphics, interactivity of the menus, and the users. This tool is highly accessible, and everyone can use it with simplicity.

### 02**Pros and Cons of the MP4 format**

**Pros of the MP4 format**

One of the critical merits of the MP4 format is that it can be valuable on different platforms.

**●** It consists of a high degree of compression while producing smaller file sizes, making it a perfect fit for compressing or video streaming HD audio-video files.

**●** An MP4 file can contain metadata and Extensible Meta Data Platform such as images based on PNG or JPEG format, subtitles, among others, and PDF.

**●** Compatible with metadata integrable with 3D graphics, user navigation or menus options, and other user interaction features.

**●** There are numerous open-source players, such as VLC Media Player, that offer full format support, even used on Linux OS.

**●** It is also versatile. For example, audio files coded with the M4A extension and MPEG-4 visual bitstreams encoded in the M4V extension.

**Cons of the MP4 format**

Note that the format is a container. This means that instead of storing the ode for the file, it keeps the data. Moreover, a specific MP4 file is based upon particular codecs because it does not have a native way of managing the involved coding.

A possible drawback is that there are hundreds of codecs available. Therefore, a media player must run a set of codecs concerning a particular MP4 file.

Yet, because the container format has become widely used, widely-supported codecs have become standards.

**●** Audio can drift out of the way or connect with the video in specific scenarios because of codec-player or codecs compatibility issues.

**●** Because a single file can contain video and audio and different metadata, editing or playback or editing needs various computing resources.

**●** It is still a lossy format. A higher compression format and smaller file size would result in audio and video quality losses.

**●** The familiarity of the MP4 format, coupled with its portability, has also enabled the illegal distribution of copyrighted audio-video files.

### 03**Is it possible to convert videos to MP4 without any software?**

No, it's impossible to do this conversion task without using any **YouTube to MP4** **video converter**. So you need to either get help from **free** **YouTube to MP4** **converter** or **YouTube MP4 converter HD** for the purpose.

### 04**Is it secure to convert YouTube videos to MP4?**

It may not be wholly safe to use an online **YouTube to MP4 video converter** for online conversion. So you have to look for different factors to get a secure **YouTube to MP4 converter online, free**, or in the software version.
