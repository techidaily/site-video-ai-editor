A reaction video can be any type of video in which the host reacts to [ideas](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and opinions that are expressed in another video. Reacting to a video that attracts a lot of attention on the Internet might put you in the middle of the debate the video you’re commenting on is covering.

**Reaction videos** boil down to expressing your attitude about the topic you feel strongly about, but they must also be entertaining to watch.

So, in this article we are going to take you through the top 5 reaction video makers you can use on PC and Mac computers.

Afterward, you should place the actual video to which you are reacting above or below the video file that contains the footage of your reaction, depending on which video clip you want to use as a background video.

However, the overlaid video is not going to be automatically visible in the preview screen, so you should just click on the Video Overlay Settings and pick the Picture in Picture option.

The video containing your reaction should be below the video you are commenting on so that the second video can be treated as an overlay. Click on the Event Pan/Crop button and readjust the size and the on-screen location of the video you’re reacting to.

Afterward, you should place the actual video to which you are reacting above or below the video file that contains the footage of your reaction, depending on which video clip you want to use as a background video.

However, the overlaid video is not going to be automatically visible in the preview screen, so you should just click on the Video Overlay Settings and pick the Picture in Picture option.

Once the OBS’ main window loads, you just have to specify the sources from which you want to record the footage. Simply right-click anywhere within the Sources tab, select the Add option and choose the Display Capture setting from the submenu.

You can then repeat the same process to select Audio Output Capture option, in order to record the audio from the video you’re reacting to.

The video containing your reaction should be below the video you are commenting on so that the second video can be treated as an overlay. Click on the Event Pan/Crop button and readjust the size and the on-screen location of the video you’re reacting to. When done, you can proceed to sync both videos so that your reactions correspond with the events in the other video. Don’t forget to preview the reaction video you’ve created before exporting it.
