## Part 1: How to Fix Audio and Video Sync Issue?

 **Why is Audio and Video out of Sync in Final Cut Pro X?**

The audio and video out of sync is a common issue faced by most Final Cut Pro X users. They experience an audio delay in their edited video that gives a bad impression and haunts the user experience.

Whenever you face an out-of-sync problem, don’t assume that the clips in your sequence are also out of sync. Multiple factors can cause sync issues, the most prominent one is by an over-taxing of the processor when it tries to run the program at its maximum. Consequently, the overstressed processer fails to sync audio and video accordingly and causes a delay.

After you have captured beautifully cinematic footage of a beach and recorded the audio separately, it’s time to add magic. If your results are crystal clear and the audio sounds melodious, you need to sync the audio and video clips and get everything lined up and cohesive.

Follow these simple steps to sync audio and video manually with Final Cut Pro X:

* First of all, import your audio and video clips and in the FCPX browser and select the ones to be synced;
* Select any two clips from imported files and right-click on them to open a dropdown menu. Choose Clip > Synchronize Clips to begin the syncing process. You can also use the shortcut Option + Command + G;

![step2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/step2.jpg)

* Final Cut Pro X will analyze the clips and create a new clip by identifying the exact sync point. Once the analysis has been completed, give a name to your newly-synced clip and select the Use Audio for syncing. Keep organization in your mind since you may have to manage with multiple clips depending on your project size. Besides, you can remove your reference audio from the video track by disabling audio components on AV clips;

![step3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/step3.jpg)

* Click OK and let the program complete the syncing process. Once the Final Cut Pro X has generated a synced clip with your specified name, click and drag that clip into your timeline.
* Go to the Audio Inspector window, identify your main audio feed, and select that audio track to isolate the channel. Playback the audio to make sure there’s no delay and it has been synced with the video. You’re done! Enjoy your synced video.

## Part 4: Fast Ways to Sync Multicam in Final Cut Pro X

Multicam is an amazing feature of the Final Cut Pro X that allows users to sync a multiple-camera job and manage unlimited video and audio angles. You can make Multicam clips with diverse media sources and include as many clips in any given angle as you want. Make sure you have labeled your clips with a camera name or an angle to make Final Cut Pro X sync Multicam properly. You can even name all the clips shot by one camera in a single step.

Follow these steps to create Multicam clips:

* Create unique folders and put all clips from each camera in these folders separately.
* Go to **Preferences > Import > Keywords** and set the Finder Tags to label the imported clips and set the shots apart from the filenames.
* In the FCPX menu, go to **View > Browser > Toggle Filmstrip/List View** for setting the Event Browser to List View. (You can also use the command OPT+CMD+2).
* If some of your clips have an incorrect time of day, you should adjust them first. Hence, select those clips and click **Modify > Adjust Content Created Date and Time.**
* In the Event Browser, select multiple clips captured with one camera or audio recorder.
* Press CMD+4 to show the Inspector, click the “i” button, and verify the clip’s information like camera name, etc.
* Give a specific camera name to the selected clips and press return and repeat the process for each audio recorder and camera.
* In the Event Browser, select multiple clips that need to be synced. Right-click on these clips and select the “Synchronize Clips” or “New Multicam Clip” option.
* Click the checkbox “Use Audio for Synchronization” to sync audio.

This way, you can sync Multicam using audio in the Final Cut Pro X. To verify or adjust the sync, open the Multicam clip in the Angle Editor and drag it to the left or right. For single-frame adjustment, you can use the comma/period keys, while the left/right angle bracket is used for 10-frame adjustments.

**Conclusion**

Final Cut Pro X is a professional video editing software used by both beginners and experienced photographers to create magic in their videos. Powered by several amazing features and advanced video-editing options, the application features a trackless magnetic timeline and supports compound clips.

Sometimes, an over-taxing of the processor may cause a delay in the video edited by Final Cut Pro X. Hence, the audio and video are out of sync that declines the video quality. To solve this problem, Apple Inc. introduced an auto-sync feature in FCPX which automatically analyzes and synchronizes the audio and video clips. You can also match audio and video manually by selecting any two clips and selecting the Synchronize Clips option.

You may wonder, is there any more way to trim audio? Yes, there is, [click here to see Best Free Online Audio Trimmers to Trim Audio Easily](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).
