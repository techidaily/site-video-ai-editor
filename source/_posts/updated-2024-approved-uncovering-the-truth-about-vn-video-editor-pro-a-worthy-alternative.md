* [Part 2: Amazing Features of Filmora You Should Try in 2021](#part2)

## Part 1  Risks of Using Illegal Filmora Torrent You Should Know

Well, there are some drawbacks and multiple threats that your PC will have to face when you download Wondershare Filmora Torrent. Some of the disadvantages and drawbacks are listed below.

### 1\.  Lack of Assistance

One of the significant setbacks of using illegal means to get Filmora is that you will not receive any technical assistance from the developer because you have not genuinely purchased the software. Moreover, if an issue occurred in your version of Filmora, you cannot even report it and get technical assistance to fix it permanently.

### 2\.  Illegal

Using an application or software that you have not genuinely purchased is a crime everywhere. However, its punishment may vary depending on the countries or regions.

### 3\.  Lack of Updates

Getting Wondershare Filmora through Torrent will block all the communication with its server. Due to this, neither will you get the notifications about the updates, nor will you be able to update your application. In a nutshell, you will get stuck with the installed version of Filmora, which will get old with time.

### 41\.  Lagging

Downloading the Filmora X torrent means you're getting a crack version, which can never match the integrity and speed of the actual version itself. Since the software's code is modified not to need an activation key to unlock all the features, the software will experience lagging whenever you use it.

### 3\.  Virus

Getting software through illegal means comes with many setbacks, and the virus is one of them. The modified copy of Filmora is not as secure as the original one. For cracking the software, they modify the .exe file, making it vulnerable to multiple threats and viruses that can harm your PC.

## Part 2  New Features of Filmora You Should Try in 2022

You cannot simply neglect Wondershare Filmora when you are talking about software for video editing that comes with brand-new editing features. Filmora is among the top-rated video editing software. It comes with many helpful features for editing videos in multiple formats. Some of its notable features are:

### 1\.  AI Portrait

AI Portrait is one of the brand-new additions in Wondershare Filmora. It allows you to [remove the background of videos without using a Chroma key and green screen effect](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You can also add glitch effects, noise, pixelated borders, segmentation video effects, and many more using AI Portrait on Wondershare Filmora.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

This feature helps you change the settings of effects and customize it according to your needs. For example, if we are talking about the noise, you can change the Percentage, Edge Thickness, Edge Feather, and Alpha with the help of this tool.

This add-on works perfectly for single and real objects facing the camera. Fast movements, backlight, and multi-person portraits influence the output of the AI portrait. However, you need to purchase this feature to add it to the Wondershare Filmora.

![Filmora remove and change video background ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-new-video-background.jpg)

### 2\.  Auto-Reframe

Powered by AI technology, this feature detects the focal point of the video automatically. Auto Reframe allows you to always keep the main object or action of the video in the frame. You can manually change the focal point of the video or opt for an aspect ratio that meets your requirements with the help of Auto Reframe.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

This feature also helps you select the focal point depending on the platform you want to share your video on. It allows you to adjust the video's speed (i.e., Auto, Slow, or Fast). You can also preview the video in real-time while reframing it.

For auto reframing the video, you need to import the media and then select auto-reframe from the Tools. After selecting the aspect ratio and adjusting the speed, analyze the video and export it in the required format.

![Filmora auto reframe feature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-auto-reframe-feature.jpg)

### 3\.  AR Stickers

Wondershare Filmora features a wide collection of AR stickers that you can use to emphasize reactions, enhance emotions, and add personality to the video. The face-tracking stickers are image-based filters with fun and attractive elements such as bears, koalas, pandas, cats, glasses, bunnies, and many more. For instance, applying the AR sticker named Heart eyes will automatically add hearts to the person's eyes and start moving with them.

AR stickers work great when tried on an object facing the camera. However, if more than one object is in the frame, the stickers will attach to any face it detects. Moreover, adding AR stickers is no complicated job. You can add them the same way as other filters. You can also delete the applied AR sticker if it looks dull or doesn't fit with your video by right-clicking on it and then selecting **Delete Effect**. However, by selecting delete effects, you will remove all the applied effects, i.e., other than AR stickers.

**Conclusion**

**[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** is one of the top-rated editing software and is well-known among content creators.

Wondershare Filmora features a wide collection of AR stickers that you can use to emphasize reactions, enhance emotions, and add personality to the video.

For instance, applying the AR sticker named Heart eyes will automatically add hearts to the person's eyes and start moving with them.

AR stickers work great when tried on an object facing the camera. However, if more than one object is in the frame, the stickers will attach to any face it detects. Moreover, adding AR stickers is no complicated job. You can add them the same way as other filters. You can also delete the applied AR sticker if it looks dull or doesn't fit with your video by right-clicking on it and then selecting **Delete Effect**.

## Part 1  Risks of Using Illegal Filmora Torrent You Should Know

Well, there are some drawbacks and multiple threats that your PC will have to face when you download Wondershare Filmora Torrent. Some of the disadvantages and drawbacks are listed below.

### 1\.  Lack of Assistance

One of the significant setbacks of using illegal means to get Filmora is that you will not receive any technical assistance from the developer because you have not genuinely purchased the software. Moreover, if an issue occurred in your version of Filmora, you cannot even report it and get technical assistance to fix it permanently.

### 2\.  Illegal

Using an application or software that you have not genuinely purchased is a crime everywhere. However, its punishment may vary depending on the countries or regions.

### 3\.  Lack of Updates

Getting Wondershare Filmora through Torrent will block all the communication with its server. Due to this, neither will you get the notifications about the updates, nor will you be able to update your application. In a nutshell, you will get stuck with the installed version of Filmora, which will get old with time.

### 41\.  Lagging

Downloading the Filmora X torrent means you're getting a crack version, which can never match the integrity and speed of the actual version itself. Since the software's code is modified not to need an activation key to unlock all the features, the software will experience lagging whenever you use it.

### 3\.  Virus

Getting software through illegal means comes with many setbacks, and the virus is one of them. The modified copy of Filmora is not as secure as the original one. For cracking the software, they modify the .exe file, making it vulnerable to multiple threats and viruses that can harm your PC.

Adding video, audio, and still, photo assets to the files pane will put them on the timeline and allow you to assemble your story.

Videos and still images are organized into bins by the app, ensuring they don't get confused on the timeline, which speeds up the workflow, especially for newcomers.

The app uses menus and can be dragged and dropped, so a single objective can be accomplished in different ways. You can control all functions from within the application frame, or dockable panels can be used to get a closer look at what needs to be done. A permanent reorganization of the workspace would be appreciated.

### **Videopad Video Editing Features**

VideoPad is the perfect balance between too much and not enough. Although there are not many options, it offers a reasonable selection of transitions for moving between clips and images, as well as a selection of filters to give them a unique look. In addition to editing 360-degree video, video stabilization is another helpful feature.

### **Videopad Audio Editing Features**

VideoPad offers a limited set of audio tools, but it does allow you to mix multiple audio tracks, music, and narration to create a movie soundtrack.

There are multiple versions of this multiplatform video editor at different price points, in addition to a free version. How can you go wrong? This is one of the reasons why VideoPad is one of the best free video editing software programs.

VideoPad Video Editor is compatible with both Mac and Windows computers and supports a number of video import and export options. This nch video editor comes with a free basic plan where you don't have to pay anything, so you can try to see how it works. In this article, we will do a quick review of this video editing software so that you have a better understanding of its features.

## **Features of VideoPad**

The features list of videopad video editor is as follows:

### **Ease of use and interface**

With VideoPad's easy-to-use interface and well-organized conventions, movie makers of any skill level can become familiar with its basics in no time at all. You will become fluent in no time at all in opening and closing windows, stringing clips together, and adding narration, transitions, and text to create a powerful visual presentation. Adding video, audio, and still, photo assets to the files pane will put them on the timeline and allow you to assemble your story.

Videos and still images are organized into bins by the app, ensuring they don't get confused on the timeline, which speeds up the workflow, especially for newcomers.

The app uses menus and can be dragged and dropped, so a single objective can be accomplished in different ways. You can control all functions from within the application frame, or dockable panels can be used to get a closer look at what needs to be done. A permanent reorganization of the workspace would be appreciated.

### **Videopad Video Editing Features**

VideoPad is the perfect balance between too much and not enough. Although there are not many options, it offers a reasonable selection of transitions for moving between clips and images, as well as a selection of filters to give them a unique look. In addition to editing 360-degree video, video stabilization is another helpful feature.

Each filter can be previewed with a click before applying it, and You can combine several to create a custom effect or template for reuse. You can also adjust their length via menus.

A video can be enhanced with transitions, visual effects, overlays, and text using VideoPad. Also included are some basic audio tools and a library of sound effects and atmospheric background music. There are a number of features that allow you to optimize videos, including color correction, adding digital images, adding subtitles, and adjusting the speed of playback. With its video stabilization feature, you can reduce camera shake, and the high-end version supports special effect plugins, but only for Windows.

### **Videopad Audio Editing Features**

VideoPad offers a limited set of audio tools, but it does allow you to mix multiple audio tracks, music, and narration to create a movie soundtrack. A video clip's audio can be faded, mixed, and adjusted for volume, but if you want to go further, you'll need an external mixer or editor. From VideoPad's main menu, you can download NCH's own WavePad.

While the text-to-speech features always sounded false, you can record narration directly within the program. There is a great idea in having voice recognition for subtitles, which is only available on the Windows version. However, the implementation falls short of expectations. Although the video was clearly spoken in a quiet environment, it automatically failed to translate into subtitles.

### **Videopad Content Sharing features**

Video creators who publish to YouTube or other social media platforms can use the software because it allows them to share videos directly to platforms such as Dropbox, Flickr, Google Drive, and Vimeo. To avoid unnecessary data sharing, you can save videos to your desktop and upload them yourself.

### **Is VideoPad worth buying?**

Although the VideoPad video editor free version is somewhat limited, it functions as a free trial to see if you like it enough to upgrade. Apps that are easy to use and have a simple interface can help convert a free user to a paying customer, and VideoPad has a strong claim to your money thanks to its simplicity and light hardware requirements.

## **Our Recommendation**

As a beginner, you may be looking to use Videopad free, but when it comes to features, it just falls short compared to modern video editors. So, we recommend you use our Filmora X video editor. Filmora video editor is free to download, so you can try out all the features without paying a penny. However free version will have a watermark when you export the video. You will have to purchase a subscription to get rid of the watermark. If you compare the features and user-friendliness of both these video editors, then Filmora definitely stands out by all means. In addition to its feature richness, it also has a user-friendly interface that beginners can easily adapt to. So, don't waste your time and give it a try right now.
