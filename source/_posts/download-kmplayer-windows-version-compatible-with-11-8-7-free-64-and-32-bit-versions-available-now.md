 2\. During the installation of KMPlayer Windows 10/8/7, there are 7 common KMPlayer bundleware including KMPlayer executable file, Set to interlock default file, KMPlayer skins, Start menu+ desktop shortcut, KMPlayer WinAMP Plugins and KMPlayer SDK, in which KMPlayer WinAMP Plugins is the baddest one that can cause some problems to your Windows OS.
