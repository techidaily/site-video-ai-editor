Such high definition video always adopts H.265/HEVC codec which is able to handle the sheer number of pixels (33.2 million)! That is to say only media players support H.265/HEVC format are capable of playing 4320p UHD videos successfully.

 However, video players that give strong backing to [H.265/HEVC playback](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) are very few.
