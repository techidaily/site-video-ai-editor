 If you are a Windows user, you may find that you can't [play DVD on Windows 10](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) computer after updating from Windows 8/8.1/7\. That's because Microsoft took away the Windows Media Center. If you want to play DVD on computer you should pay $14.99 or use Microsoft's half-baked DVD player which always failes to playback a few of DVD movies. So, why not turn to the  free and always reliable DVD video player\-5KPlayer to replace the Windows 10's DVD app.

**2\. Can't Play DVD on MAC OS (MacBook Air/Pro) Computer**   
 There may be two reasons: 1\. Apple DVD player can work only if you launch a third party tool to copy DVD to DVD media file first; 2\. With the exception of MacBook Pro (without Retina Display), all new Macs no longer feature DVD SuperDrive. That is to say you need to pay extra money for an external optical drive, after that you can play DVD on your Mac computer. But very luckily, it's possible to play DVD on your Mac without buying external drive thanks to MacX DVD Ripper Free-a free DVD ripping software for Mac OS.
