First, if your 2019 Macbook Pro/Air is running Mac OS X El Captain or Yosemite, Netflix movie streaming is directly available in its native browser - Safari (latest version) - with the built-in settings for html5 video.   
 Second, should you be running Mountain Lion or earlier, follow the[official instructions](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/2086) from netflix.com which describes how you can install a plug-in called **Silverlight** in order to watch, which we provide below:

![How to Watch Netflix on Mac](https://www.5kplayer.com/video-music-player/img/netflix-in-browser.jpg) 

**Step 1:** Vist www.netflix.com on your Mac computer, choose the New Year movies on Netflix you want to play.  
**Step 2:** When a Silverlight dialog windows opens, hit "Install Now", which takes you to install Silverlight.dmg, kindly notice that download location is different depending on your web browser.  
**Step 3:** Right-click or hold Control on your Mac's keyboard and select Silverlight.pkg, then select "Open" on the popping-up menu.  
**Step 5:** Upon the warning "Silverlight.pkg is not from the Mac App Store. Are you sure you want to open it? Opening Silverlight.pkg will always allow it to run on this Mac.", proceed with a "Yes".  
**Step 6:** Follow the installation wizard to successfully install Silverlight for Netflix Mac APP.

**Notes:** Should the Netflix plug-in Silverlight for Mac fails to download, you may also access it through Microsoft Silverlight website at https://www.microsoft.com/getsilverlight/Get-Started/Install/Default.aspx.  
**Pros:** No extra cost.  
**Cons:** Safari on Mac streams most of Netflix movies just fine. But if [Netflix 4K Movies](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) or [Netflix 3D movies](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/youtube-download/) is also your cup of tea, then think twice. Just like Amazon Prime Video, they **doesn't make 4K content available on Netflix for Mac** (or PC).

![Watch Netflix movies on Mac](https://www.5kplayer.com/video-music-player/../youtube-download/img/watch-alita.png) 

**Pros:**  No plug-in required (which is a must if you don't have either 5KPlayer or the latest version of macOS Catalina).  
 Remote control available: with Netflix installed in iPhone, you're free to start/resume where you left/switch movie titles without being tethered to the Mac's range.  
 Money-saving: Netflix charges on device at $7.99 and $9.99 for 1 device and 2 devices respectively, but with 5KPlayer installed, you only pay for the least.  
**Cons:** Movies may stop when receiving phone calls when you connect iPhone.

#### **Method 3: Pay $2.99\~$6.99: 3rd Party APP to Access Netflix APP for Mac**

As you may already found in the Mac APP Store, a slew of unofficial Netflix APP client for Mac obtain themselves quite a few downloads selling from $2.99 to $6.99\. These are APPs transmitting your original Netflix subscription content into a Mac desktop APP. But some users may find this method hiccupping quite often. Streaming via APP Flix, or even the top-rated FlixMaster won't go as smooth as the authentic service on Mac computer. So if you can just do without an APP, Safari-based Netflix for Mac will suit fine.

![3rd Party Netflix App for Mac](https://www.5kplayer.com/video-music-player/img/3rd-party-netflix.jpg) 

**Pros:** Rendering APP-based Netflix for Mac experience.  
**Cons:** Cost extra. Incompatibility issues may occur, taking you some time to check out this tutorial on [Netflix won't play \[solved\]](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/).

 Ok, that's all for my recommendations. Now that we don't have a standalone Netflix desktop APP for Mac, it goes up to you to choose: a plugin for browser will suit fine if you don't need Netflix 4K content, and there're plenty of 3rd party Netflix APP for Mac client. 

But to get all functions you need at one stroke, it's still the all-round alternative to Netflix for Mac - **[5KPlayer](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/)**!
