Homido is a VR headset maker itself, but it also provides 306 VR video player for iOS and Android alike, and that is the Homido 360 VR player app. This is like the coolest VR player for iPhone iOS since they have a lot to offer:

There are basically 4 sections for Homido iOS vr player users: 360 degree spherical videos, standard video enjoyment (3D/2D), built-in web browser that can let you turn the view into side by side mode and a recording section that allow you record VR video using iPhone straight through this app.

Homido gives you full side by side control of the app even at its menu UI. Turn sideways, or rotating the screen and your Homido shipped iOS will present you 360 degree video enjoyment. It works good with phones without smart phone adapter and you can view 360 videos.

The most stunning part of this app is that it can stream vr 360 videos directly using its built-in browser and even if the video is not 360, Homido can compress the vid into spherical ones. In the library you can even launch any your own videos shoot with bubble lens or other ways.

#### ![](https://www.5kplayer.com/video-music-player/../seoimg/2.png) **Mobile VR Station iOS**

The set-up for mobile VR station for iPhone is a bit painful but after doing that, you can get quite a smooth VR video watching experience. One good thing about Mobile VR station is that you can conduct all the settings by using Mobile VR Station head tracking pointer which allows you to point and select icons on the floating control panel. With its inbuilt "eye mode" you can also watch normal 2D videos.

The drawback of this VR player for iPhone is that it only supports transferring VR content to your iOS iPhone from iTunes meaning that this iOS VR player does not support online VR watching directly from sites like YouTube. 

#### ![](https://www.5kplayer.com/video-music-player/../seoimg/3.png) **Total cinema 360 player**

Total Cinema 360 has supports for web browsers, iOS mobiles and PC, namely Total Cinema 360° web player, mobile player and Total Cinema 360 Oculus Player. For iOS devices, it allows you to view 360° content saved in your mobile media library, or stream 360° videos to your device directly from the web. The Total Cinema 360° Mobile Player is integrated with the Web Player, allowing 360° videos on the web to be downloaded and opened directly in the Mobile Player. The Mobile Player is compatible with Google Carboard. 

However, when watching 3D VR movies, or playing 3D VR games, alongside the above-mentioned "immersive" and "interactive" experience as of left-to-right, you can raise eyes into the sky (or down to the ground) to find solid objects - the tagline difference between 3D VR and traditional 3D movies - when you look up above a 3D movie screen only to find the curtain or cinema wall.

#### ![](https://www.5kplayer.com/video-music-player/../seoimg/4.png) **Within iOS Player**  (formerly Vrse)

Though this iOS player downscales the video quality of VR, to enjoy immersive VR experience, it is enough for the beginners. 3D movies side-by-side mode and home cinema can be quite impressive. However, just like Mobile VR station, it can only load and view local VR 360 videos. So you will have to transfer videos to your iOS iPhone.

iOS vr video player is not enough for the immersive experience and enjoyment? Right, you need some great vr game apps to dive deeper. The below are the most favorite vr game app you might also find intriguing.

• **InMind VR**, playable teaser for a brain themed shooter.  
• **The Height**, a rather old game with multiple levels, the objective is to collect cubes, fast on slow phones, still interesting due to the use of height which is always impressive in VR.  
• **Froggy VR**, a cartoon style kid friendly multi-level game involving eating flies and hopping around a pond.   
• **Virtual Kaiju 3D**, USD 0.99, a strange commercial VR rampage game, played as a Godzilla like monster. You have to roar into the microphone to spit fire. Interesting primarily for the weird concept.   
• **Zombie Shooter VR**, a shooter on rails.   
• **Moorente**, simple duck shooting game.
