## Guide: How to MKV Files on PC

Anyway, spend a few more minutes here before deciding on which method to play MKV. We have another 2 to offer:  
\-> Method 2: Install MKV codec pack  
\-> Method 3: Convert MKV to MP4/AVI

**Method 2: Install MKV Codec to Play MKV Files on PC**

Before you download any of the MKV Codec given below, let me first specify - that either your Windows operating system version (Windows 7 and 8/8.1) or the media player in use might hinder when playing MKV files. 

Anyhow, if none of the suggested MKV file players suit your flavor, let's proceed to the list of MKV Codec which will enable media players to open MKV files, here we have:   
 . For Windows Media Player:   
 Matroska Pack Full - 13.4 MB in total; Available for download at http://www.softsea.com/download/Matroska-Pack-Full.html  
 Note:  
This is an all-included MKV codec, check as of which one(s) you need to play MKV files on PC, including: FFDShow, Haali Media Splitter, VSFilter, FLAC, TTA, etc.  
Also works for DirectShow Player, Media Player Classic.  
. For DirectShow Player:  
 CCCP - 9.7 MB in total; Available for download at: http://www.softsea.com/review/CCCP-Combined-Community-Codec-Pack.html  
 Note:  
Also works for Windows Media Player.  
K-Lite Codec Pack Full; Available for download at: http://www.softsea.com/review/K-Lite-Codec-Pack-64-bit.html

**Note:** Take great care for any malicious plug-ins that might harm your Windows PC binding the codec pack you download. Cease immediately when your antivirus reports risks.

**Method 3: Convert MKV to MP4/AVI and Play**  
Converting MKV to MP4 guarantees 99% of compatibility to play MKV files on PC as MP4 works with pretty much every known video player not only on Windows PC.

There are plenty of MKV to MP4 converters to choose from, and one with HD support can suit you better, for example, the WinX HD Video Converter Deluxe ->> [Get giveaway version](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/).   
 This is because the process of [converting MKV to MP4](https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/products/) vary: especially when you want to keep the original elements in an MKV file, whose H.264 video, AAC audio, multiple audio tracks, subtitles, chapter, etc. are all wrapped into the old MKV file container.  
 An in-class MKV to MP4 converter like WinX HD Video Converter Deluxe would be masterful to drive MKV files into appropriate formats that won't choke your media player on PC, but if you just need to[convert MKV to MP3](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/youtube-download/), 5KPlayer will do fine. 

In short, if you ever have the demand for MKV codec, or MKV to MP4 converter, chances are that you media player in use is already outdated. Matroska as the most adaptive contain format ever can not only incorporate popular H.264, H.265 MP4, VP8, VP9 video with AAC, MP3 audio, subtitle files, it is a future-oriented container to support forthcoming encoding standard, according to Howtogeek. 

You are, hence, 300% encouraged, to adopt real MKV file player which can render state-of-the-art video codecs like MKV, AVI, AVCHD and more.

Our recommendation for 5KPlayer, which tops a recommendation of [top 5 media players for Windows 10](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/), is downright universal for not only Matroska files, it supports H.264, H.265, Webm and a lot many up to its sleeve. Running a media play that won't open play MKV files on PC? - Time to phase it out, for that can be called a backward one with HD streaming becoming the mainstay in YouTube, Netflix and other video sharing websites.
