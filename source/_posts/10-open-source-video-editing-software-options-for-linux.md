Luckily, there are simple ways to help remove watermarks from any video. However, some of this software is easy to use; you to edit the video file before uploading it to YouTube or any platform of your choice. Below are two simple steps to remove a watermark from a video:

### 1\. Remove Watermark with the Crop tool

This method will entirely remove the watermark from your movie, but it will also crop out a portion of the video that contains the watermark. It might not work well with all video options, so you might lose some vital parts of the video frame. However, you can use Wondershare Filmora software to crop out the edges containing the watermark.

By this, import your video, right-click on the timeline, zoom the video and click on “crop” to manually trim the edges to your chosen size or use the automatic option to select a ratio. Now adjust the edges of the cropping box to remove the watermark. You’ve successfully erased a watermark from your movie by clicking OK to apply the cropping effect.

However, one of the setbacks is that you will have to cut out some parts of the video, and it does not work if the watermark is in any other position other than the corners.
