### What is Hardware Acceleration?

Speaking of hardware acceleration, the difference of [software decoding and hardware decoding](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) is the priority to talk about:  
**Software decoding** – the first technique to play a video, software decodes the video and reads the information using CPU only.  
**Hardware decoding** – decodes videos faster by transferring the heavy decoding job to GPU that CPU is capable of doing so.  
 More specifically, high-res video decoding is an extremely CPU-occupying task that a computer with low-power CPU can't handle other tasks normally if the CPU is used to decode high definition videos. That is to say, your computer needs a helper – GPU that is able to do such heavy decoding jobs to allow CPU to concentrate on other duties to make computer work as smooth as usual during a smooth high-res video playback.

However, GPU won't work automatically as for [HD/UHD videos playback](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) unless you utilize a video player with hardware acceleration ability that can start up the GPU decoding process on your computer. And luckily, here is the place where GPU accelerated video player is provided.

##  Top 6 Hardware Accelerated Video Players
