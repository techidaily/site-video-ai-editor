### What is Hardware Acceleration?

Speaking of hardware acceleration, the difference of [software decoding and hardware decoding](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) is the priority to talk about:  
**Software decoding** – the first technique to play a video, software decodes the video and reads the information using CPU only.  
**Hardware decoding** – decodes videos faster by transferring the heavy decoding job to GPU that CPU is capable of doing so.  
 More specifically, high-res video decoding is an extremely CPU-occupying task that a computer with low-power CPU can't handle other tasks normally if the CPU is used to decode high definition videos. That is to say, your computer needs a helper – GPU that is able to do such heavy decoding jobs to allow CPU to concentrate on other duties to make computer work as smooth as usual during a smooth high-res video playback.

However, GPU won't work automatically as for [HD/UHD videos playback](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) unless you utilize a video player with hardware acceleration ability that can start up the GPU decoding process on your computer. And luckily, here is the place where GPU accelerated video player is provided.

**No.2 VLC Media Player - DXVA2 D3D11 Hardware Decoding for 4K/8K**

Always considered to be the leader in the media player market, VLC 3.0 Vetinari had improved hardware decoding technology recently to get GPU accelerated so as to expedite the hardware decoding from MPEG-1, MPEG-2, WMV3, VC-1 and H.264 (MPEG-4 AVC) to H.265/HEVC, VP9, 4K, 8K and HDR in a much easier manner. By using DxVA2 and D3D11 hardware decoding tech including GPU-zerocopy mode and hardware filtering for deinterlace and adjust, VLC video player with hardware acceleration [plays 8K 60fps on Windows 10 using i7 GPU](https://vimeo.com/254723528)/Mac smoothly and renders perfect HEVC 10bit performance and HDR 360 3D audio playback as well.
