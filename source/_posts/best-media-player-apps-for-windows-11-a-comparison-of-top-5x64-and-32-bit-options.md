**\[NO.1\] VLC 2.2.6 (64 Bit) Media Player for Windows 10 (vlc-2.2.6-win64.exe)**

★★★★★ Rating: 5.0 | OS: Windows, Mac & More | Type: Open source 

Starting from scratch VLC media player 64 bit is written in the 64 bit architecture of 64-bit Linux by its talented developers, and considering the fact that VLC's hardware acceleration utility supports 0-copy on GPU while enabling it to fallback on software when required, this media player x64 works fine with such advanced media codecs as UDP/RTP Unicast, UDP/RTP Multicast, HTTP / FTP, MMS, TCP/RTP Unicast, etc. While some users find [VLC 64 bit for Windows 10](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) a feature-rich upgrade worth considering, others reported troubling bugs like [VLC not playing DVD](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) or [VLC not playing MP4](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) problems. Should you run into any bugs while using VLC Media Player 64 bit, please visit https://www.videolan.org/support/#bugs to report a bug.

**\[No.2\] Best Free 64-bit/32-bit Media Player for Windows 10 – 5KPlayer** 

★★★★★ Rating: 5.0 | OS: Windows, Mac | Type: Free 

The industry-leading [5KPlayer](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/) outshines any other 64-bit media players for Windows 10 thanks to its scientific computing kernel and cutting-edge graphic processing capability. With hardware acceleration units landing on its last but one version, the free 5KPlayer outpaces any other 64-bit/32-bit media players out there in the market. With it, you are allowed to play multiple media files including MP4, MKV, AVI, AV1, FLV, H.264, HEVC, etc. up to 4K and even 8K. No need to install codec packs, it's powerful to handle what you throw at it including some lesser-known container format like OGVM and ASF.

Besides, unlike Windows Media Player 64 bit for Windows 10, the full-fledged 5KPlayer can natively [play DVD](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/), ISO\_image, DVD folders and VOB videos without charging you extra. By playing multi-region DVDs for free, this is rather a-stitch-in-time-saves-nine effort for this free 64 bit media player.

**\[NO.3\] Media Player Classic – Black Edition 64-bit Video Player for Windows 10**

★★★★☆ Rating: 4.5 | OS: Windows | Type: Free 

Very portable and lightweight, the 64 bit of MPC-Black Edition is another much-favored option, even better than the widely-known MPC-HC 64 bit. Unlike the all-you-can-eat VLC 64 bit, MPC-HC integrates all its salient features into a less-than-22 MB installer, thus applicable to even compact tablets & netbooks and Ultrabooks like Surface Pro.

Just like 5KPlayer, [Media Player Classic 64 bit for Windows 10](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) supports hardware acceleration in the video decoding process, which indeed facilitates the playback of ultra-hd videos. However, subtitle loading has long remained chronic headache of this media player 64-bit for Windows 10, and you'll need to pay special attention of [MPC-HC's MKV problems](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/).

**\[NO.4\] KMPlayer 64-bit for Windows 10** 

★★★★ Rating: 4.0 | OS: Windows & Mac | Type: Free 

As one of the big name media player 64-bit, KMPlayer for Windows 10 was bought by Pandora.tv back in 2008 while also making itself available for free. Indeed, this is a comprehensive x64 media player that supports a wide variety of container format such as VCD, DVD, AVI, MKV, Ogg as well as RealMedia, satisfying user demand if they have a media library containing media files of different container formats. 

However, the opposite is true if they kind of dislike possible bundle-ware to be downloaded along with this media player.

**\[NO.5\] Windows Media Player 64 Bit**

 ★★★★ Rating: 4.0 | OS: Windows & Mac | Type: Free 

It's extremely simple to install Windows Media Player 12 and make use of its ample features. This nifty little upgrade from WMP 11 on July 22, 2009 was built on the achievements of its previous version to work on Windows 7/8/10\. First off, Windows Media Player 64 bit players more media types than its predecessors – aside from supporting most AVI, DivX, MOV – but regretfully no MKV – so that you'll still need to [download MKV codec](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) for Windows Media Player 64 bit to get the popular videos in Matroska containers up and playing.

However, WMP 64 bit is gradually losing its popularity in that no more upgrades has been heard of since its 2009 revamp.
