## Choosing the best video trimmer for you; desktop or online?

Choosing an online or desktop video trimmer is a decision only you, as a professional, can make. Still, the truth is desktop trimmers work more efficiently than online solutions for a good number of reasons.

Accuracy: Though online video trimmers might look a bit faster than desktop options, it might not give the flexibility to make changes at will like the desktop options.

Efficiency: If you enjoy working without an internet connection, or have issues with a reception where you reside, then the online video trimmers are not for you.

Space: However, online versions are best suited for people using PCs with low storage space and saving space and time. However, if you want to edit generally and not just trim videos alone, most desktop options come with other editing features than trim.

Speed: Also, because you do not have to wait for an internet signal, desktop video trimmers render faster than online video trimmers (though still depending on system speed).

Verdict: It will be best to try desktop video trimmers for major projects. Online solutions are online cool while either doing a test project or for personal use.

## Conclusion

● The fact remains that the efficiency of your editing software or tool has a huge influence on your productivity. And even though choosing the best video trimmer for your next project might seem dicey, following a simple review like this will make it easy to select from the best and try to know what works best for you.

## Choosing the best video trimmer for you; desktop or online?

Accuracy: Though online video trimmers might look a bit faster than desktop options, it might not give the flexibility to make changes at will like the desktop options.

Efficiency: If you enjoy working without an internet connection, or have issues with a reception where you reside, then the online video trimmers are not for you.

Space: However, online versions are best suited for people using PCs with low storage space and saving space and time. However, if you want to edit generally and not just trim videos alone, most desktop options come with other editing features than trim.

Speed: Also, because you do not have to wait for an internet signal, desktop video trimmers render faster than online video trimmers (though still depending on system speed).

Verdict: It will be best to try desktop video trimmers for major projects. Online solutions are online cool while either doing a test project or for personal use.

## Part 5: FAQ about Animated Logo Makers

### 1\. Which software is best for logo animation?

Logo animation software is not short on the ground. Most regular editing programs will have features that let you add an animation to your logo. We would recommend that you look at After Effects, by Adobe, since it contains numerous features specifically dealing with animation. You may even be able to use the free version of this software without paying for the whole program.

Logo animation software in aftereffects usually needs to be applied to existing footage. Otherwise, you can find it available for download by following this link.

### 2\. How do I make an animated logo?

When you are using Filmora Pro as your logo animation software, there are steps you need to take to achieve full animation. First, prepare your file by opening a new workspace with a web resolution of about 320 x 240\. Select your background layer, then add in any graphics or art you have for your logo. Choose the effect you want to apply and drag and drop it, then adjust the settings in the box that pops up.

You can assign keyframes for specific actions or play with the settings to achieve the animation you had in mind.

### 3\. How do I make an animated logo for free?

PixTeller is such an excellent service because it has logo animation software that is free to use. It allows you to work with all types of formats. So if you have a logo as a JPEG, or whether you want to draw it out in vector graphics, you can do so.
