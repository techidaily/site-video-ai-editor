## Top 8 HLS Players for Windows & Mac to Play HLS Files

 _Posted by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last update: July 16, 2020_

HLS protocol supported Apps or websites allow M3U8 files to be played on their servers, such as YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and so on, but if you want to open the HLS video on a desktop browser, it could be very difficult. Problems like video format cannot be recognized, the video played without audio, audio is not synced with video, file read to be empty, etc., but what's worse is that there is no way to solve these problems on desktop browsers. Why is it so hard to find ways to play HLS protocol video? Should I turn to look for an HLS media player? Here are the straightforward reasons and easiest solutions for you to solve the problems.

## What Is HLS file?

HTTP Live Streaming, aka HLS, is an HTTP-based adaptive bitrate streaming communications protocol published by Apple Inc. Not only has it become the preferred streaming media protocol on iPhone, iPad, and Safari browser, but many broadcasters also use HLS and its variant protocols for content distribution.

It works by dividing live videos or on-demand content into many pieces of small file downloads, and let the client download based on standard HTTP transactions. When playing content delivered using HLS, the client needs to download the M3U8 file containing metadata information (such as index file, playlist or manifest file, etc.). At the same time, the client streams the content of different bitrates according to the network conditions.

The M3U8, the Unicode version of M3U, is a computer file format with a file extension of .m3u or .m3u8\. It was originally designed for the purpose of describing MP3 music. It is commonly used to describe the HLS protocol index file.

HLS supports a wide range of video and audio formats, including MPEG2-TS, fragmented MP4, AAC, MP3, AC3 and EAC3 format. For subtitles, it only supports the WebVTT format.

## Why Some Browsers and Players Won't Open HLS Files Properly?

First and foremost, to have your existing operating system supports HTTP Live Streaming. Now we know that HLS playback is natively supported on Windows 10, macOS 10.6 and the later, iOS 3 and the later, and Android 4.1 and the later. Confirm whether your operating system meets the above conditions, if not, you have to upgrade it to meet the requirement. 

Then, codec is the second dimension that has clearly done its stuff. Usually, as mentioned above, HLS has the service architecture comprises video files in H.264 format and audio in AAC, MP3, AC-3, EC-3, or HE-AAC, but some servers also use H.265 HEVC video codec, such as VODOBOX Live Server, ANEVIA Genova Live, Elecard CodecWorks, etc. Therefore, only with the relevant player, browser extension or codec pack installed you can decode the video and audio data to play HLS protocol videos.

Browsers like Google Chrome and Firefox natively support HTTP Live Streaming on iOS and Android, but as to desktop browsers, only very few of them has the ability to stream HLS. For example, Google Chrome version 4 to 70 does not support HLS properly, Mozilla Firefox version 2 to 63 does not support HLS, Safari browser version 3.1 to 5.1 does not support HLS and the later version only partially supports HLS, Internet Explorer version 6 to 11 does not support browser element HLS, Opera browser doesn't support the browser element HLS, etc. Until the newest version of those browsers, HLS is still only partially supported on Windows and macOS PCs. 

Although the browser is very convenient, it cannot meet the needs of HLS playback, so, compared with other complicated programs, the player has become the best choice. But, some media players without HTTP Live Streaming function or relevant codec support cannot handle M3U8 video playback.
