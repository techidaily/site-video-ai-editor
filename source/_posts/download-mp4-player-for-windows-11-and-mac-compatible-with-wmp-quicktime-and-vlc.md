### MP4 Codec vs. MP4 Player: Is MP4 Codec the Best Choice?

MP4 codec pack is indeed the prerequisite for a computer to play MP4 files but installing external codecs is not that ideal. First, third-party codec pack from unauthorized sites may contain virus, adware or spyware that may conflict with your programs and even corrupt your operating system of computer. Second, the newly downloaded codec pack may conflict with the existed codecs on your computer. Third, the third-party MP4 codec pack probably doesn't update for a very long time, for example the CCCP last updated in 2015, so this kind of MP4 codec maybe not compatible with your media player. Besides, we didn't find any well-known sites to offer MP4 codecs for Mac computer. **– These are the shortages of MP4 codec**

Therefore, the [MP4 player](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) is better. A professional MP4 player often comes with embedded MP4 codecs like H.265, H.264, MPEG-4, etc that used to encode MP4 videos files. Without the need of downloading extra MP4 codec pack which may lead several troubles, a MP4 player lets you play any MP4 files videos directly and easily. **– That's why MP4 player is better than MP4 codec**
