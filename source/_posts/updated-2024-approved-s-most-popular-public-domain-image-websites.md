 Finding an image you like on the Internet doesn’t take long, since almost every website you can stumble upon, contains at least one picture. This doesn’t mean that you can just download any photo and use it in your blog, online marketing campaign or for any other purpose. Moreover, stock image websites like Getty Images or iStock let you purchase the right to use a photo commercially. As a reaction to an expanding stock image industry, many photographers, museums and cultural institutions are choosing to forfeit their rights and to publish public domain images. So, in this article, we are going to take you through the ten best public domain image websites where you can download pictures for free.

## What Are Public Domain Images?

 By definition, public domain images are photos, vectors or clip art that are available to anyone because their copyright has either expired or they never had a copyright owner. Consequently, anyone can use these images for both commercial or private projects without having to purchase the rights to do so. An image can enter a public domain under the following circumstances:

* Scientists, educators or artists can use the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license to dedicate their images to the public domain
* A picture’s copyright is no longer in effect
* A photo was never the subject to copyright

 It is of utmost importance to check if an image is within the public domain before you use it publicly in order to avoid potential legal complications.

## How and Where to Find Public Domain Images?

 A simple google search will reveal hundreds of websites that let you download public domain and royalty-free images. Which source you’re going to use depends on the type of image you’re looking for, since some websites are dedicated only to photography, while others feature impressive collections of public domain images of artworks. In addition, you’ll only want to download public domain images from the websites that offer information about the author because using a public domain image without crediting its author is strictly prohibited.

## Best Websites for Downloading Public Domain Images

 Finding an image you like on the Internet doesn’t take long, since almost every website you can stumble upon, contains at least one picture. This doesn’t mean that you can just download any photo and use it in your blog, online marketing campaign or for any other purpose. Moreover, stock image websites like Getty Images or iStock let you purchase the right to use a photo commercially. As a reaction to an expanding stock image industry, many photographers, museums and cultural institutions are choosing to forfeit their rights and to publish public domain images. So, in this article, we are going to take you through the ten best public domain image websites where you can download pictures for free.

## What Are Public Domain Images?

 By definition, public domain images are photos, vectors or clip art that are available to anyone because their copyright has either expired or they never had a copyright owner. Consequently, anyone can use these images for both commercial or private projects without having to purchase the rights to do so. An image can enter a public domain under the following circumstances:

* Scientists, educators or artists can use the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license to dedicate their images to the public domain
* A picture’s copyright is no longer in effect
* A photo was never the subject to copyright

 It is of utmost importance to check if an image is within the public domain before you use it publicly in order to avoid potential legal complications.

## How and Where to Find Public Domain Images?

 A simple google search will reveal hundreds of websites that let you download public domain and royalty-free images. Which source you’re going to use depends on the type of image you’re looking for, since some websites are dedicated only to photography, while others feature impressive collections of public domain images of artworks. In addition, you’ll only want to download public domain images from the websites that offer information about the author because using a public domain image without crediting its author is strictly prohibited.

## Best Websites for Downloading Public Domain Images

With several video-sharing platforms and billions of videos on those platforms, it is very difficult and competitive to make your mark and have an identity. There are hundreds of categories of videos that you can find on the platforms like Youtube, Dailymotion, Vimeo, and more. Among all those categories, reaction videos are one of the most popular categories. It allows a person to review another person's opinion, view, or idea about any particular issue or instance. Most of the video-sharing platforms enable their users to make all kinds of reaction videos without any restriction. Having such a huge competition makes it hard to stand out and attract viewers.

Have you ever seen videos where the reactor has a transparent background instead of the rectangle box in the corner? They look nice and engaging, right? The process of making such videos will require so many materials such as a green screen, stand, and other materials to support it. It is difficult for everyone to afford all these and secondly, it is very difficult to carry from one place to another.

---

With Filmora X, you can create such transparent background reaction videos without such expensive material. Filmora has launched a new feature name AI Portrait that uses artificial intelligence to create amazing and cool effects. It uses the latest technology to separate the background and humans in the footage to help you remove the background with a single click. So, let's get started with the process of making stunning reaction videos with Filmora's AI Portrait.

**Step 02:** Import the video that you want to react to and your reaction video. If you have not already recorded your reaction, then record it first using any camera or smartphone.

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step2.png)

**Step 03:** Place both of these videos into the timeline. Make sure to place your reaction above.

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step3.png](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step3.png)

**Step 04:** Select your reaction video on the timeline and go to the "Effects". Here you will find a new folder named "AI Portrait", open it. Here you will find multiple AI portrait effects.

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step4.png)

**Step 05:** Our goal is to remove the background of the reaction. To do that, we will use Human Segmentation. Drag and drop Human Segmentation into the reaction video. If you haven't purchased this effect already, it will ask you to buy it to export the video. But you want to try it first, click on "Try It."

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step5](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step5.png)

**Step 06:** Once the effect is successfully applied to the video, its background will be removed automatically.

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step7](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step7.png)

**Step 08:** To make your video look cool and stunning, you can also add multiple other effects to your reaction. AI portrait allows you to add a border around the character to make it look more visible and separate it from another video. Go to the AI portrait and drag Human Border Effect and drop it into your reaction. It will create an outline around the character and make it look more visible.

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step8](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step8.png)

**Step 09:** In some instances, you might need to change the position or size of your reaction. You can easily do that by applying the Keyframes to it. If you feel like changing the part of your reaction at some point in the video, go to that point in the timeline and click on the keyframe button above the timeline.

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step9.png)

**Step 10:** Once you click on the keyframe, it will add a keyframe to the video. Now move forward into the timeline to a point and adjust your character's position by dragging it. Let's move it to the bottom right corner. It will add another keyframe to the video in the timeline. Now the character will change its position from the left corner to the right corner once it reaches that specific point in time.

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step10](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step10.png)

#### Conclusion
