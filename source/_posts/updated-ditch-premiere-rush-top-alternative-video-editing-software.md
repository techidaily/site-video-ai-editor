 Adobe have recently released their new multi-platform video editing tool named [Adobe Rush](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-rush.html). It promises to be the first of its type in the world, allowing hassle video editing and publishing to a multitude of platforms.

 Dubbed the video editing tool for the YouTube generation, having been designed from the ground up for online video creators. Editing is simple via its suite of audio and visual tools, including title screens, transition effects and color adjustment tools. Export is optimized for all social platforms available, including Vimeo, Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat.

 Despite the promise of the perfect video editing tool, it's not been entirely warmly received. Some complain that the editing tools are just too basic, others that the price is uncompetitive. Other issues have been raised with slow rendering capabilities and general instability of the platform, causing crashes that can set projects back by hours.

 We're going to take a look at some of the alternatives to Adobe Rush out there, which may be more capable of getting the job done.

## Shortages of Adobe Rush

#### System requirements

| Devices                                                 | Requirements                |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| PC                                                      | Windows 10 (v1709 or later) |
| 8 GB of RAM                                             |                             |
| 8 GB of available hard-disk space                       |                             |
| Multicore processor with 64-bit support                 |                             |
| Mac                                                     | macOS 10.13 or later        |
| 8 GB of RAM                                             |                             |
| 8 GB of available hard-disk space                       |                             |
| Multicore Intel processor with 64-bit support           |                             |
| iPhone/iPad                                             | iOS 11 or later             |
| iPhone 7 and newer (devices with A9 ARM chip or higher) |                             |
| Android                                                 | Not available now           |

 Windows users will need to be upgraded to the latest version of the operating system, at least version 1709 as a minimum. You'll also need at least 8GB of RAM if you want to avoid the system crashing every time you use it.

 Despite having computers that meet the required spec, numerous users have complained that Adobe Rush is buggy and repeatedly crashes. Some say that the laggy performance makes it almost impossible to use.

 An alternative is to use Rush on your iPhone, but for this you'll need to own at least an iPhone 7, preferably something newer. In testing, we found it to be very slow, even on an iPhone X. If you're an Android user, you'll need to wait to experience the 'Rush', because this software is not available for your handset yet. Adobe have said they are working on it and how to have it ready at some point in 2019.

#### Performance

 As a video editing tool, it's fairly competent, but for anything more than the basics, it's somewhat lacking. Many of the most basic video editing tools are missing, and the platform supports only three transitions, so if you're into making longer or more complex videos, its just not going to work.

 In terms of rendering, we found it incredibly slow in comparison to some of the alternatives to Adobe Rush. The background music choices are pretty limited too, and most of it is not what you want accompanying your cutting-edge videos.

 What really broke the deal for us was the inability to specify the output of your video files. This means that although social sharing could be OK, you're going to be stuck if you want to share it in other locations. It's great to see a video editing app on iPhone, but overall, it's really nothing special.

#### Price

 If you already subscribe to the Adobe Create Cloud (CC) suite, then Rush will be included in your subscription. However, if you want to subscribe to it as a standalone app, the price is $9.99 a month for individuals. This is not particularly competitive with the alternatives to Premier Rush, and could be prohibitively expensive for the hobbyist, which is, after all, the market Adobe are aiming at.

## Alternatives to Adobe Rush for All Platforms

 While Adobe are marketing Rush as a 'cross platform' video editor, there are alternatives to Premier Rush which do the job just as well, if not better, and often for a lot less.

**1\. For Windows - Wondershare Filmora**

 We love [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) as an alternative to Adobe Rush for Windows. Unlike Rush, you can pick and choose your video output format, as Filmora is compatible with all major video file types including mp4, FLV, MKV, AVI, MOV and more. Instead of being limited to a handful of basic effects, Filmora supports more than [300 high performance effects](https://effects.wondershare.com/) and filters to perfect your visual appeal.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

 As well as being a video editor, Filmora is a working audio editor too, featuring a full mixer and equalizer to bring your music and speech to life. There're no transitional limitations, and you can even use green-screen technology, tilt-shift and jump cut features to make your videos pop.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-rush-alternatives-filmora-9.jpg)

 Each video can use up to 99 timelines to make it easier to edit and customize your work. Finally, and a big plus for many of us, you don't need to have the latest and best PC in order to use this software. Wondershare Filmora works on Windows 7, 8 and 10, and requires only 3GB of RAM. If you want to work in HD or 4K quality, however, you will need 8GB RAM.

**2\. For Mac - iMovie**

[iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/) is a powerful editing tool designed for iOS and perfect to use on a Mac. Using your own photos and videos, you can create polished movies complete with titles and even a credits roll. It's great for turning memories into beautiful keepsakes, which can then be shared with family and friends via social media or direct from your Apple device.

 Check this article to see the [comparison between Adobe Rush and Apple iMovie](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-rush-alternative-imovie.jpg)

 The user-friendly interface makes it possible for even the most novice of users to harness the power of digital video editing. Complete with templates and easy to use tools, even beginners can make high quality trailers, logos and cinema like productions.

 iMovie lets users access a number of special effects and enhancements, as well as ten filters to improve the images. Music can be chosen from their own library, and narrative voice overs are possible too. We think iMovie is one of the best alternatives to Adobe Rush available for Mac.

**3\. For Android - Filmora**

 As Rush is not yet available for the Android platform, users must look for alternatives to Premier Rush if they want to go ahead and start making movies. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a great solution, as powerful as most of the desktop editors you'll come across and with all the features you need to get started.

 Clips can be selected from your own device, or from Facebook or Google, and then added into your project folder to be created into a movie. They can then be arranged into a handy timeline, using simple drag and drop functionality which is easy for even beginners to master. There are even in-built themes which you can try out to turn your home movies into something special.

 For switching between stills or video clips, there are a raft of fun transitions available to make it a more cohesive production. You can adjust colors, brightness, speed and more, as well as adding in subtitles and editing in music. One of the best features of this software is the picture-in-picture function, where you can add another video or still over the main one. It's free and amazing fun, and we think one of the best alternatives to Adobe Rush for Android.

**4\. For iOS - LumaFusion**

[LumaFusion](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lumafusion/id1062022008?mt=8) is a powerful multi track video editor which has been built for the mobile marketplace. It's widely used by professional filmmakers and journalists, which is why we've picked it as one of the best alternatives to Premier Rush for iOS users.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-rush-alternatives-lumafusion.jpg)

 It's not the easiest app to get started with, but the creators have made a ton of tutorial videos to help you get to grips with it. Capability wise, it's amazing, with up to three tracks for photos, videos, graphic and titles as well as an additional three audio tracks for narration, music and sound effects.

 Video editing includes a wealth of special effects, from color correction tools to transitions, as well as an audio track mixer which can be adjusted on the fly. Title pages can be created, as well as adapting the speed and ratio of playback. Sharing the finished project can be done via social media, cloud storage, disk storage and more.

### Conclusion

 It's great to see more software like Adobe Rush coming onto the market; however, it's important to realize that, despite the hype, there may still be drawbacks to some of these systems. For us, Adobe Rush was exactly that something for editing videos in a rush. If you're serious about making awesome clips though, investigating some of these alternatives to Adobe Rush.

 Before you shell out the high subscription price for Adobe products, it's worth considering what you really want from your software. Having some goals in mind will allow you to compare the different alternatives to Premier Rush to see where the best value for money lies.

It's great to see a video editing app on iPhone, but overall, it's really nothing special.

#### Price

 If you already subscribe to the Adobe Create Cloud (CC) suite, then Rush will be included in your subscription. However, if you want to subscribe to it as a standalone app, the price is $9.99 a month for individuals. This is not particularly competitive with the alternatives to Premier Rush, and could be prohibitively expensive for the hobbyist, which is, after all, the market Adobe are aiming at.

## Alternatives to Adobe Rush for All Platforms

 While Adobe are marketing Rush as a 'cross platform' video editor, there are alternatives to Premier Rush which do the job just as well, if not better, and often for a lot less.

**1\. For Windows - Wondershare Filmora**

 We love [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) as an alternative to Adobe Rush for Windows. Unlike Rush, you can pick and choose your video output format, as Filmora is compatible with all major video file types including mp4, FLV, MKV, AVI, MOV and more. Instead of being limited to a handful of basic effects, Filmora supports more than [300 high performance effects](https://effects.wondershare.com/) and filters to perfect your visual appeal.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

 As well as being a video editor, Filmora is a working audio editor too, featuring a full mixer and equalizer to bring your music and speech to life. There're no transitional limitations, and you can even use green-screen technology, tilt-shift and jump cut features to make your videos pop.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-rush-alternatives-filmora-9.jpg)

 Each video can use up to 99 timelines to make it easier to edit and customize your work. Finally, and a big plus for many of us, you don't need to have the latest and best PC in order to use this software. Wondershare Filmora works on Windows 7, 8 and 10, and requires only 3GB of RAM. If you want to work in HD or 4K quality, however, you will need 8GB RAM.

**2\. For Mac - iMovie**

[iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/) is a powerful editing tool designed for iOS and perfect to use on a Mac. Using your own photos and videos, you can create polished movies complete with titles and even a credits roll. It's great for turning memories into beautiful keepsakes, which can then be shared with family and friends via social media or direct from your Apple device.

 Check this article to see the [comparison between Adobe Rush and Apple iMovie](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-rush-alternative-imovie.jpg)

 The user-friendly interface makes it possible for even the most novice of users to harness the power of digital video editing. Complete with templates and easy to use tools, even beginners can make high quality trailers, logos and cinema like productions.

 iMovie lets users access a number of special effects and enhancements, as well as ten filters to improve the images. Music can be chosen from their own library, and narrative voice overs are possible too. We think iMovie is one of the best alternatives to Adobe Rush available for Mac.

**3\. For Android - Filmora**

 As Rush is not yet available for the Android platform, users must look for alternatives to Premier Rush if they want to go ahead and start making movies. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a great solution, as powerful as most of the desktop editors you'll come across and with all the features you need to get started.

 Clips can be selected from your own device, or from Facebook or Google, and then added into your project folder to be created into a movie. They can then be arranged into a handy timeline, using simple drag and drop functionality which is easy for even beginners to master. There are even in-built themes which you can try out to turn your home movies into something special.

 For switching between stills or video clips, there are a raft of fun transitions available to make it a more cohesive production. You can adjust colors, brightness, speed and more, as well as adding in subtitles and editing in music. One of the best features of this software is the picture-in-picture function, where you can add another video or still over the main one. It's free and amazing fun, and we think one of the best alternatives to Adobe Rush for Android.

**4\. For iOS - LumaFusion**

[LumaFusion](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lumafusion/id1062022008?mt=8) is a powerful multi track video editor which has been built for the mobile marketplace. It's widely used by professional filmmakers and journalists, which is why we've picked it as one of the best alternatives to Premier Rush for iOS users.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-rush-alternatives-lumafusion.jpg)

 It's not the easiest app to get started with, but the creators have made a ton of tutorial videos to help you get to grips with it. Capability wise, it's amazing, with up to three tracks for photos, videos, graphic and titles as well as an additional three audio tracks for narration, music and sound effects.

 Video editing includes a wealth of special effects, from color correction tools to transitions, as well as an audio track mixer which can be adjusted on the fly. Title pages can be created, as well as adapting the speed and ratio of playback. Sharing the finished project can be done via social media, cloud storage, disk storage and more.

### Conclusion

 It's great to see more software like Adobe Rush coming onto the market; however, it's important to realize that, despite the hype, there may still be drawbacks to some of these systems. For us, Adobe Rush was exactly that something for editing videos in a rush. If you're serious about making awesome clips though, investigating some of these alternatives to Adobe Rush.

 Before you shell out the high subscription price for Adobe products, it's worth considering what you really want from your software. Having some goals in mind will allow you to compare the different alternatives to Premier Rush to see where the best value for money lies.

 Mar 27, 2024â€¢ Proven solutions

 Adobe have recently released their new multi-platform video editing tool named [Adobe Rush](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-rush.html). It promises to be the first of its type in the world, allowing hassle video editing and publishing to a multitude of platforms.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-rush-alternatives-1.jpg)

 Dubbed the video editing tool for the YouTube generation, having been designed from the ground up for online video creators. Editing is simple via its suite of audio and visual tools, including title screens, transition effects and color adjustment tools. Export is optimized for all social platforms available, including Vimeo, Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat.

 Despite the promise of the perfect video editing tool, it's not been entirely warmly received. Some complain that the editing tools are just too basic, others that the price is uncompetitive. Other issues have been raised with slow rendering capabilities and general instability of the platform, causing crashes that can set projects back by hours.

 We're going to take a look at some of the alternatives to Adobe Rush out there, which may be more capable of getting the job done.

## Shortages of Adobe Rush

| 8 GB of RAM                                             |                             |

| Android                                                 | Not available now           |

 Windows users will need to be upgraded to the latest version of the operating system, at least version 1709 as a minimum. You'll also need at least 8GB of RAM if you want to avoid the system crashing every time you use it.

 Despite having computers that meet the required spec, numerous users have complained that Adobe Rush is buggy and repeatedly crashes. Some say that the laggy performance makes it almost impossible to use.

 An alternative is to use Rush on your iPhone, but for this you'll need to own at least an iPhone 7, preferably something newer. In testing, we found it to be very slow, even on an iPhone X. If you're an Android user, you'll need to wait to experience the 'Rush', because this software is not available for your handset yet. Adobe have said they are working on it and how to have it ready at some point in 2019.

#### Performance

 As a video editing tool, it's fairly competent, but for anything more than the basics, it's somewhat lacking. Many of the most basic video editing tools are missing, and the platform supports only three transitions, so if you're into making longer or more complex videos, its just not going to work.

 In terms of rendering, we found it incredibly slow in comparison to some of the alternatives to Adobe Rush. The background music choices are pretty limited too, and most of it is not what you want accompanying your cutting-edge videos.

 What really broke the deal for us was the inability to specify the output of your video files. This means that although social sharing could be OK, you're going to be stuck if you want to share it in other locations. It's great to see a video editing app on iPhone, but overall, it's really nothing special.

#### Price

 If you already subscribe to the Adobe Create Cloud (CC) suite, then Rush will be included in your subscription. However, if you want to subscribe to it as a standalone app, the price is $9.99 a month for individuals. This is not particularly competitive with the alternatives to Premier Rush, and could be prohibitively expensive for the hobbyist, which is, after all, the market Adobe are aiming at.

## VLC Tips: Playing Videos at a Slower Speed

While the files of the most common formats like MP4, WAV, etc. may look identical, they might be compiled using varied codecs which may or may not support any random player that you install on your PC. The reason why VLC media player is used by the majority of users worldwide is the versatility in the codecs that it supports natively.

Furthermore, the app is available for almost every platform, i.e., Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android, and is absolutely free to download and use.

With that said, the following sections explain how to manage the playback speed of a video while using VLC media player to add a slow motion effect to video. Here you will learn **how to play slow motion on VLC** on Windows, Mac, and iOS/Android, and also how to set the default speed for the app so that every time a video is played, the speed remains according to your preference.

#### In this article

01 [How to Play Video in Slow Motion Effects on Windows with VLC?](#part1)

02 [How to Play Slow Motion Effects on Mac with VLC?](#part2)

03 [How to Control Playback Speed in VLC Media Player on Android and iOS?](#part3)

04 [How to Set up the Default Playback Speed on VLC?](#part4)

## Part 1: How to Play Video in Slow Motion Effects on Windows with VLC?

VLC is one of the [best media players to play videos in slow motion](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You can follow the instructions that are given below to learn how to play a video in slow motion in VLC on a Windows PC:

**Step 1: Start Video Playback**

Launch VLC on your Windows computer (a Windows 11 PC is used here for illustrations), click **Media** from the menu bar at the top, click **Open File** from the menu, and locate and open a video that you want to watch in slow motion. If VLC is your default media player, simply double-clicking the clip automatically opens the file in the app.

![open file to play slow motion on vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-file-to-play-slow-motion-on-vlc.jpg)

**Step 2: Reduce the Playback Speed (In Decrements of 0.10x)**

Once the playback begins, press the **Spacebar** on the keyboard to pause the video. Next, go to the **Playback** menu from the top, go to **Speed**, and click **Slower (fine)** once. This will reduce the speed to 0.90x. Clicking **Slower (fine)** again will further slow down the video to 0.80x speed. You can repeat this process until you reduce the speed to your desired level. Press **Spacebar** again to resume the playback in slow motion.

**Note:** The lowest speed that you can go to using this process is 0.03x.

![vlc playback slower slow motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-playback-slower-slow-motion.jpg)

**Step 3: Reduce the Playback Speed (In Decrements in Percentage)**

Pause the playback and go to **Playback** \> **Speed** as explained in the previous step. From the list that comes up, click **Slower** (the last option). This will reduce the speed to 0.67x. Click **Slower** again and the speed will further go down to 0.50x. You can repeat this process until you reach your desired playback speed. Press **Spacebar** to resume the playback in slow motion. With this method, you can reduce the speed to as low as 0.02x.

**Note:** You can click **Normal** from the **Speed** submenu to play the video at normal speed.

![play video slow motion on vlc slower](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-video-slow-motion-on-vlc-slower.jpg)

**Step 4: Using the Shortcut Keys (Optional)**

You can press the left square bracket â€˜**\[**â€˜ on your keyboard to reduce the speed in decrements of 0.10x. To get back to the normal speed, press the equals to â€˜**\=**â€™ key. Likewise, pressing the right square bracket â€˜**\]**â€™ increases the speed by 0.10x.

**Note:** As it is with the **Slower (fine)** and **Slower** options, you can use **Faster (fine)** to add 0.10x increments to the speed, and **Faster** to increase percentage-wise. Also, if **Faster (fine)** is clicked repeatedly or its shortcut key is used multiple times, the speed can be increased up to 31.25x. On the other hand, by using the **Faster** option repeatedly, the speed can be increased to more than 100x.

## Part 2: How to Play Slow Motion Effects on Mac with VLC?

The process of slowing down the video playback in VLC on a Mac computer is almost identical to that in Windows. You can learn how to get this done by following the steps that are given below:

**Step 1: Open and Pause the Video**

Locate and right-click the video that you want to play in slow motion, go to **Open With** from the context menu, and click **VLC** from the submenu. Once the clip opens, click the **Pause** button from the bottom as explained in the previous section.

**Step 2: Reduce the Playback Speed**

Click **Playback** from the menu bar at the top, and drag the **Playback Speed** slider to the left to reduce the speed of the video.

![play video slow motion on vlc mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-video-slow-motion-on-vlc-mac.jpg)

**Step 3: Resume the Playback**

Click anywhere on the screen to close the **Playback** menu, and then click the **Play** button from the bottom to resume the video playback in slow motion.

## Part 3: How to Control Playback Speed in VLC Media Player on Android and iOS?

Although the playback speed of a video on both Android and iOS devices can be controlled with a slider, the location where the controller is placed on the two platforms varies, and so does the process of reaching there. Both the methods are explained below for your convenience:

### Play Video in Slow Motion on Android with VLC

**Step 1: Pause the Playback**

Launch VLC on your Android phone (Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ is used here for illustrations), locate and open the video in VLC, tap anywhere on the screen, and tap the **Pause** button from the bottom to pause the playback.

**Step 2: Set a Slower Playback Speed**

Tap the **More** icon from the bottom-right corner, tap **Playback speed** from the menu that appears, and drag the slider that is present at the bottom to the left to reduce the speed. Alternatively, you can also repeatedly tap the down arrow that is present at the right of the slider to slow down the speed in the decrements of 0.05x.

![play speed slow motion vlc android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-speed-slow-motion-vlc-android.jpg)

**Step 3: Resume the Playback**

Tap anywhere on the screen, and when the **Playback speed** slider disappears, tap the screen one more time. Now, tap the **Play** icon from the bottom to resume the video playback.

### Play Video in Slow Motion on iPhone with VLC

**Step 1: Pause the Playback**

Assuming that you have already added the video to the VLC library by connecting it to iTunes, launch the app on your iOS device (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustrations). Tap the video that you want to play in slow motion, and then tap the **Pause** icon from the bottom.

**Step 2: Reduce the Playback Speed**

Tap anywhere on the screen, and tap the **Clock** icon from the lower-left corner. Next, drag the **Playback speed** slider to the left to reduce the playback speed.

![vlc iphone playback speed slow motion effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-iphone-playback-speed-slow-motion-effect.jpg)

**Step 3: Resume the Playback**

Right after decreasing the speed, tap the **Play** icon from the bottom to resume the playback. If the controllers disappear, you can tap anywhere on the screen again, and then tap the **Play** icon.

## Part 4: How to Set up the Default Playback Speed on VLC?

The processes of setting up default playback speed on different platforms and devices vary. For your convenience, all of them are explained below:

### Set up Default Playback Speed in VLC on Windows

1. Go to **Tools** \> **Preferences** in VLC media player, and then click the **All** button from the **Show settings** section at the bottom.
2. Select **Input / Codecs** from the left pane of the **Advanced Preferences** box, and then specify your preferred speed in the **Playback speed** field that is present under the **Playback control** section on the right window
3. Click **Save** to save the changes

![set vlc media player default playback speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-vlc-media-player-default-playback-speed.jpg)

### Set up Default Playback Speed in VLC on Mac

* Launch VLC, and go to **VLC media player** from the menu bar, and then click **Preferences;** and then click **Show All** from the bottom of the **Preferences** box to display all preferences setting options;

![vlc media player default preferences interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-media-player-default-preferences-interface.jpg)

* Click the **Input / Codecs** from the left pane, and then define your preferred speed in the **Playback speed** field under the **Playback control** section in the right window, and then click **Save** to save the changes.

![change vlc media player default speed mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-vlc-media-player-default-speed-mac.jpg)

### How to Change VLC Media Player Default Speed on Android

**Note:** At the time of this writing, the Android version of VLC doesnâ€™t allow you to set a global default playback speed. However, you can set it on a per video basis. This means that every time that video is played, the playback speed will remain what you set for it. You must do this for each video in your VLC library individually.

* Launch VLC, and then tap **More** from the bottom-right corner; next, tap **SETTINGS** from the upper-left area;
* Tap **Video** from the **Extra settings** section, and then check the **Save Playback Speed** box

![change media default playback speed android vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-media-default-playback-speed-android-vlc.jpg)

### How to Change VLC Media Player Default Speed on iOS and iPhone

* Tap **Settings** from the Home screen, and then scroll down and tap **VLC**
* Tap **Default playback speed** from the **GENERIC** section, and then tap to select a playback speed from the available list to set it as the default.

![change default playback speed vlc iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-default-playback-speed-vlc-iphone.jpg)

**Conclusion**

It is pretty convenient to reduce the playback speed in VLC media player regardless of the platform or device you are using. While the processes of getting the job might be different, the principle behind it remains the same. When on Windows, the playback speed can be decreased to 0.02x and can be increased to more than 100x. This facility is not available on Mac, iOS, or Android platforms. Also, if you want, you can set the default playback speed for the videos so that every time a clip is played, the pace remains what you specified as default.

If VLC is your default media player, simply double-clicking the clip automatically opens the file in the app.

![open file to play slow motion on vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-file-to-play-slow-motion-on-vlc.jpg)

**Step 2: Reduce the Playback Speed (In Decrements of 0.10x)**

Once the playback begins, press the **Spacebar** on the keyboard to pause the video. Next, go to the **Playback** menu from the top, go to **Speed**, and click **Slower (fine)** once. This will reduce the speed to 0.90x. Clicking **Slower (fine)** again will further slow down the video to 0.80x speed. You can repeat this process until you reduce the speed to your desired level. Press **Spacebar** again to resume the playback in slow motion.

**Note:** The lowest speed that you can go to using this process is 0.03x.

![vlc playback slower slow motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-playback-slower-slow-motion.jpg)

**Step 3: Reduce the Playback Speed (In Decrements in Percentage)**

Pause the playback and go to **Playback** \> **Speed** as explained in the previous step. From the list that comes up, click **Slower** (the last option). This will reduce the speed to 0.67x. Click **Slower** again and the speed will further go down to 0.50x. You can repeat this process until you reach your desired playback speed. Press **Spacebar** to resume the playback in slow motion. With this method, you can reduce the speed to as low as 0.02x.

**Note:** You can click **Normal** from the **Speed** submenu to play the video at normal speed.

![play video slow motion on vlc slower](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-video-slow-motion-on-vlc-slower.jpg)

**Step 4: Using the Shortcut Keys (Optional)**

You can press the left square bracket â€˜**\[**â€˜ on your keyboard to reduce the speed in decrements of 0.10x. To get back to the normal speed, press the equals to â€˜**\=**â€™ key. Likewise, pressing the right square bracket â€˜**\]**â€™ increases the speed by 0.10x.

**Note:** As it is with the **Slower (fine)** and **Slower** options, you can use **Faster (fine)** to add 0.10x increments to the speed, and **Faster** to increase percentage-wise. Also, if **Faster (fine)** is clicked repeatedly or its shortcut key is used multiple times, the speed can be increased up to 31.25x. On the other hand, by using the **Faster** option repeatedly, the speed can be increased to more than 100x.

## Part 2: How to Play Slow Motion Effects on Mac with VLC?

The process of slowing down the video playback in VLC on a Mac computer is almost identical to that in Windows. You can learn how to get this done by following the steps that are given below:

**Step 1: Open and Pause the Video**

Locate and right-click the video that you want to play in slow motion, go to **Open With** from the context menu, and click **VLC** from the submenu. Once the clip opens, click the **Pause** button from the bottom as explained in the previous section.

## Part 3: How to Control Playback Speed in VLC Media Player on Android and iOS?

Although the playback speed of a video on both Android and iOS devices can be controlled with a slider, the location where the controller is placed on the two platforms varies, and so does the process of reaching there. Both the methods are explained below for your convenience:

### Play Video in Slow Motion on Android with VLC

**Step 1: Pause the Playback**

Launch VLC on your Android phone (Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ is used here for illustrations), locate and open the video in VLC, tap anywhere on the screen, and tap the **Pause** button from the bottom to pause the playback.

**Step 2: Set a Slower Playback Speed**

Tap the **More** icon from the bottom-right corner, tap **Playback speed** from the menu that appears, and drag the slider that is present at the bottom to the left to reduce the speed. Alternatively, you can also repeatedly tap the down arrow that is present at the right of the slider to slow down the speed in the decrements of 0.05x.

### Play Video in Slow Motion on iPhone with VLC

**Step 1: Pause the Playback**

Assuming that you have already added the video to the VLC library by connecting it to iTunes, launch the app on your iOS device (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustrations). Tap the video that you want to play in slow motion, and then tap the **Pause** icon from the bottom.

**Step 2: Reduce the Playback Speed**

Tap anywhere on the screen, and tap the **Clock** icon from the lower-left corner. Next, drag the **Playback speed** slider to the left to reduce the playback speed.

Right after decreasing the speed, tap the **Play** icon from the bottom to resume the playback. If the controllers disappear, you can tap anywhere on the screen again, and then tap the **Play** icon.

## Part 4: How to Set up the Default Playback Speed on VLC?

The processes of setting up default playback speed on different platforms and devices vary. For your convenience, all of them are explained below:

### Set up Default Playback Speed in VLC on Windows

1. Go to **Tools** \> **Preferences** in VLC media player, and then click the **All** button from the **Show settings** section at the bottom.
2. Select **Input / Codecs** from the left pane of the **Advanced Preferences** box, and then specify your preferred speed in the **Playback speed** field that is present under the **Playback control** section on the right window

### How to Change VLC Media Player Default Speed on Android

**Note:** At the time of this writing, the Android version of VLC doesnâ€™t allow you to set a global default playback speed. However, you can set it on a per video basis. This means that every time that video is played, the playback speed will remain what you set for it. You must do this for each video in your VLC library individually.

* Launch VLC, and then tap **More** from the bottom-right corner; next, tap **SETTINGS** from the upper-left area;
* Tap **Video** from the **Extra settings** section, and then check the **Save Playback Speed** box

**Conclusion**

It is pretty convenient to reduce the playback speed in VLC media player regardless of the platform or device you are using. While the processes of getting the job might be different, the principle behind it remains the same. When on Windows, the playback speed can be decreased to 0.02x and can be increased to more than 100x. This facility is not available on Mac, iOS, or Android platforms. Also, if you want, you can set the default playback speed for the videos so that every time a clip is played, the pace remains what you specified as default.

Even though you can use vignetting in any type of photo or video, it is still advisable to carefully choose the images to which youâ€™d like to add this effect, since the results youâ€™re going to get depend mostly on the quality of the original footage. Here are the ten best vignette apps in 2019.

#### 1. Apple Photos App

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS

iPhone users can edit their photos with the built-in Photos app that offers a variety of photo and video shooting modes as well as a rich collection of filters and effects. The **Vignette effect** can be accessed from the **Edit Photo menu,** by tapping on the **Adjust button** and then opening the **Add menu** and selecting the effect from the list. The **Auto option** will be enabled by default and it will automatically adjust the vignette based on the composition of your photo. Alternatively, you can use the **strength, Softness or Radius** settings to control the size of the darkened area of the image or the vignetteâ€™s falloff. Even though the Photos app offers basic Vignetting tools that let you choose which part of a photo is going to be affected by the effect or how intense the effect is going to be, it is still better to use a more powerful photo editing app to create vignettes from your iPhone.

#### 2. Final Touch

**Price:** $0.99

**Compatibility:** iOS

![Vignette Effects app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/final-touch-vignette.jpg)

When creating a vignette, the lack of control over the feathering or opacity features can significantly limit your ability to produce vignettes that look natural. The Final Touch app is equipped with powerful vignetting tools that let you choose between **square, ellipse or circle shapes** of vignettes, move and rotate a vignette or adjust the feather size and fall off. However, the app doesnâ€™t let you take photos, which means that all images you want to edit have to be imported from the camera roll. The Final Touch also offers a number of preset vignettes you can easily apply to a photo and customize in any way you want. After youâ€™ve completed the vignetting process, you can share a photo to your social media accounts directly from the app.

#### 3. Snapseed

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Android, [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snapseed/id439438619?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8)

This photo editing app offers much more than the Vignette tool, as its users can process images in both **JPEG and RAW** file formats. Tap on the **Pencil icon** to access the appâ€™s **Tool menu**, select the **Vignette option** and then proceed to adjust the **Outer and Inner Brightness** sliders. This will enable you to precisely define how dark you want the photoâ€™s edges to be or how bright the central part of the picture is. To change the size of the vignette you just have to pinch in or out on the phoneâ€™s screen and **Center Size option** will appear near the bottom of the screen. Tap on the **Save button** once youâ€™re happy with the results and then hit **Export** to create a copy of the photo that contains the changes youâ€™ve made.

#### 4. VSCO

**Price:** Free, but contains in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vsco.cam&hl=en), iOS

![Vignette Effects app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vsco-vignette-app.jpg)

Besides being a powerful photo editor, the VSCO app is also a community of photography enthusiasts where you can discover inspiring work or connect with like-minded people. The app also features a collection of effects that enable you to recreate the look of vintage film produced by **Kodak, Fuji or Agfa.** Despite remarkably powerful photo editing options, VSCO is far from a perfect choice if you want to add a vignette to your photo since it only offers **basic vignetting tools**. You can add a vignette to a photo the same way youâ€™d apply any other effect, but you wonâ€™t have access to advanced feathering options. iPhone and Android users in need of an app that lets them shoot and edit photos and videos should give VSCO a chance. Keep in mind that video editing options are only available if you purchase the VSCO X Membership.

#### 5. Afterlight 2

**Price:** $2.99

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/afterlight-2/id1293122457?mt=8)

![Vignette Effects app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/afterlight-2-vignette-app.jpg)

iPhone photographers who would like to use photo editing tools such as **Curves, Selective Hue/Saturation or Clarify** are going to love using the Afterlife 2 app. Adding a vignette to a photo requires you to just tap on the **Adjustment Tools icon** and then **browse through the adjustment tools icons until you find the Vignette option**. Just tap on the Vignette icon to create the effect and then proceed to adjust the settings. Donâ€™t expect too much control over the vignette size or feathering options, since Afterlight 2 only offers basic vignetting tools. Optionally, you can use Afterlight 2 as an **extension for the Apple Photos App** if you want to broaden the scope of photo editing tools you have at your disposal when using this native iPhone app.

#### 6. PhotoToaster

**Price:** $2.99

**Compatibility:** iOS

![Vignette Effects app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/phototoaster-photo-editor-vignette-app.jpg)

A brief look at the list of features PhotoToaster app provides will leave you wondering if there is anything this app canâ€™t do. There are over eighty different one-click settings in **Lightning, Vignette, Texture or Border** categories that grant you total creative control over the photo editing process. You can add a vignette to a photo you imported into the app from your iPhoneâ€™s camera roll, but you canâ€™t use PhotoToaster to take photos. Furthermore, you can use the lightning adjustments to balance the shadows and highlights or process colors on separate channels. The PhotoToaster app is a great asset to all photographers who take photos with their iPhones, not only because it lets them create vignettes in just a few taps, but because it enables them to edit their photos professionally.

#### 7. PicsArt Photo Editor

**Price:** Free, but contains in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.picsart.studio&hl=en), [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/picsart-photo-editor-collage/id587366035?mt=8)

Adjust the **Radius and Fade** sliders before picking the color of the vignette. **Tap on the Checkmark icon to confirm the changes** youâ€™ve made and save the photo. PicsArt is a vibrant community of photography enthusiasts where you can share your works with other users or connect with photographers you like.

#### 8. EffectsStudio

**Price:** $0.99

**Compatibility:** iOS

![Vignette Effects app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/effects-studio-app.jpg)

The user-friendly interface and the abundance of photo editing options, make the EffectsStudio one of the best iOS-based photo editing app you can use to add vignettes to your photos.

#### 9. EyeEm

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baseapp.eyeem&hl=en), iOS

![Vignette Effects app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/eyeem-photography-vignette.jpg)

#### 10. ToolWiz Photos

**Price:** Free, but contains in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** Android, [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/toolwiz-photos/id1002417201?mt=8)

This simple photo editing app offers **AI filters**, and effects you can apply to a picture in just a single tap. All effects, including the Vignette effect located in the **Photography menu**, are fully customizable, so you can **adjust the radius or choose where the center of the vignette is going to be**. When done, you just have to tap on the **Checkmark icon** to confirm the changes you made and then proceed to apply an art filter like **Grainy Film or use Fish Eye, Double Exposure or Mirror effects**. The appâ€™s file sharing capabilities could be better since you have to save all the photos you edit to your phone.

**Conclusion**

Making the edges of a photo darker can without a doubt make your photos stand out, but falling in love with vignettes and using this effect excessively is not necessarily a great idea. Using vignettes in your photos subtly so they arenâ€™t easy to notice will probably create the best results. Which iPhone or Android vignette app do you use to edit your photos? Leave a comment and let us know.

**Conclusion**

Making the edges of a photo darker can without a doubt make your photos stand out, but falling in love with vignettes and using this effect excessively is not necessarily a great idea. Using vignettes in your photos subtly so they arenâ€™t easy to notice will probably create the best results. Which iPhone or Android vignette app do you use to edit your photos? Leave a comment and let us know.

Sharing unedited photos and videos on your social media accounts can negatively reflect on the number of views and like your posts are getting. You donâ€™t necessarily have to know a lot about photo or video editing process in order to add a vignette to a picture or adjust its color, brightness or highlights. As a matter of fact, all you need is a great app that lets you emphasize the center of the image and darken its edges. Thatâ€™s why in this article we are going to take you through some of the best vignette apps for iPhones and Android devices that make the vignetting process fun.

## Top 10 Vignette Apps in 2024 \[Free & Paid\]

Vignettes can be used to make your selfies look more artistic or to increase the contrast between the edges and the center of a landscape photo. Even though you can use vignetting in any type of photo or video, it is still advisable to carefully choose the images to which youâ€™d like to add this effect, since the results youâ€™re going to get depend mostly on the quality of the original footage. Here are the ten best vignette apps in 2019.

#### 1. Apple Photos App

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS

iPhone users can edit their photos with the built-in Photos app that offers a variety of photo and video shooting modes as well as a rich collection of filters and effects. The **Vignette effect** can be accessed from the **Edit Photo menu,** by tapping on the **Adjust button** and then opening the **Add menu** and selecting the effect from the list. The **Auto option** will be enabled by default and it will automatically adjust the vignette based on the composition of your photo. Alternatively, you can use the **strength, Softness or Radius** settings to control the size of the darkened area of the image or the vignetteâ€™s falloff. Even though the Photos app offers basic Vignetting tools that let you choose which part of a photo is going to be affected by the effect or how intense the effect is going to be, it is still better to use a more powerful photo editing app to create vignettes from your iPhone.

#### 2. Final Touch

**Price:** $0.99

**Compatibility:** iOS

![Vignette Effects app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/final-touch-vignette.jpg)

When creating a vignette, the lack of control over the feathering or opacity features can significantly limit your ability to produce vignettes that look natural. The Final Touch app is equipped with powerful vignetting tools that let you choose between **square, ellipse or circle shapes** of vignettes, move and rotate a vignette or adjust the feather size and fall off. However, the app doesnâ€™t let you take photos, which means that all images you want to edit have to be imported from the camera roll. The Final Touch also offers a number of preset vignettes you can easily apply to a photo and customize in any way you want. After youâ€™ve completed the vignetting process, you can share a photo to your social media accounts directly from the app.

#### 3. Snapseed

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Android, [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snapseed/id439438619?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8)

This photo editing app offers much more than the Vignette tool, as its users can process images in both **JPEG and RAW** file formats. Tap on the **Pencil icon** to access the appâ€™s **Tool menu**, select the **Vignette option** and then proceed to adjust the **Outer and Inner Brightness** sliders. This will enable you to precisely define how dark you want the photoâ€™s edges to be or how bright the central part of the picture is. To change the size of the vignette you just have to pinch in or out on the phoneâ€™s screen and **Center Size option** will appear near the bottom of the screen. Tap on the **Save button** once youâ€™re happy with the results and then hit **Export** to create a copy of the photo that contains the changes youâ€™ve made.

#### 4. VSCO

**Price:** Free, but contains in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vsco.cam&hl=en), iOS

![Vignette Effects app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vsco-vignette-app.jpg)

Besides being a powerful photo editor, the VSCO app is also a community of photography enthusiasts where you can discover inspiring work or connect with like-minded people. The app also features a collection of effects that enable you to recreate the look of vintage film produced by **Kodak, Fuji or Agfa.** Despite remarkably powerful photo editing options, VSCO is far from a perfect choice if you want to add a vignette to your photo since it only offers **basic vignetting tools**. You can add a vignette to a photo the same way youâ€™d apply any other effect, but you wonâ€™t have access to advanced feathering options. iPhone and Android users in need of an app that lets them shoot and edit photos and videos should give VSCO a chance. Keep in mind that video editing options are only available if you purchase the VSCO X Membership.

#### 5. Afterlight 2

**Price:** $2.99

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/afterlight-2/id1293122457?mt=8)

![Vignette Effects app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/afterlight-2-vignette-app.jpg)

iPhone photographers who would like to use photo editing tools such as **Curves, Selective Hue/Saturation or Clarify** are going to love using the Afterlife 2 app. Adding a vignette to a photo requires you to just tap on the **Adjustment Tools icon** and then **browse through the adjustment tools icons until you find the Vignette option**. Just tap on the Vignette icon to create the effect and then proceed to adjust the settings. Donâ€™t expect too much control over the vignette size or feathering options, since Afterlight 2 only offers basic vignetting tools. Optionally, you can use Afterlight 2 as an **extension for the Apple Photos App** if you want to broaden the scope of photo editing tools you have at your disposal when using this native iPhone app.

#### 6. PhotoToaster

**Price:** $2.99

**Compatibility:** iOS

![Vignette Effects app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/phototoaster-photo-editor-vignette-app.jpg)

A brief look at the list of features PhotoToaster app provides will leave you wondering if there is anything this app canâ€™t do. There are over eighty different one-click settings in **Lightning, Vignette, Texture or Border** categories that grant you total creative control over the photo editing process. You can add a vignette to a photo you imported into the app from your iPhoneâ€™s camera roll, but you canâ€™t use PhotoToaster to take photos. Furthermore, you can use the lightning adjustments to balance the shadows and highlights or process colors on separate channels. The PhotoToaster app is a great asset to all photographers who take photos with their iPhones, not only because it lets them create vignettes in just a few taps, but because it enables them to edit their photos professionally.

#### 7. PicsArt Photo Editor

**Price:** Free, but contains in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.picsart.studio&hl=en), [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/picsart-photo-editor-collage/id587366035?mt=8)

Adjust the **Radius and Fade** sliders before picking the color of the vignette. **Tap on the Checkmark icon to confirm the changes** youâ€™ve made and save the photo.

You just have to import a photo from the camera roll and enter the appâ€™s **Edit mode** to start processing a photo.
