**msiexec /i QuickTime.msi /qn TRANSFORMS=FIX.mst ALLUSERS=1 /log C:\\QT\\install.log**

![](https://www.5kplayer.com/video-music-player/../seoimg/10.png) Note: A log file called install.log will be created in the C:\\QT folder, which should end with something along the lines of "Return code 0". If not, and QuickTime wasn't installed, you may look in this file for any possible error codes (opens fine in Notepad or WordPad). Alternatively, you will need to download and install the older version QuickTime v7.7.6.
