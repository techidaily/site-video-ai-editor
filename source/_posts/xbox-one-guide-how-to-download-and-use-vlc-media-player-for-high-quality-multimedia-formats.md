#### **VLC for Xbox One Flaws When Playing Media Files & Solutions**

**1\. SMB Problems on Xbox One**

_**Problem:** "…Tried some mkv that didn't work on Xbox One Microsoft's own player but found a problem while connecting to a SMB drive. It asks for user/pass but after entering it the app just closes (checked several times). User/pass I enter are verified ok (tested from a laptop)…"_  
**Solution:** Simply set Windows Control Panel -> Network and Internet -> Network and Sharing Center -> Advanced sharing settings -> Turn off password protected sharing. 

**2\. VLC for Xbox One Crashes**

_**Problem:** "VLC for Xbox One crashes when backgroud streaming music via UPNP."_  
**Solution:** According to the questioners, they are not 100% sure what causes the crahses because VLC for Xbox One sometimes works flawlessly for several hours and sometimes it crashes in the middle of a song after ten minutes. Constantly restarting Xbox One VLC works but a bit frustrating that you may wait for the official version which is much more stable. Or download [VLC alternative](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) for Windows 10 if you just want to smoothly streaming music. 

**3\. XBox One VLC Folder Shuffle & Refresh Issues**

I have ransacked the forums but find no answer to Xbox One VLC shuffle problem. Probably it is because the beta version has some bugs or it doesn't support the function at present. Luckily, you can shut down the Xbox One completely and restart it to solve the Xbox One VLC folder not refreshing problem, though it is a bit annoying.
