## How to Rotate a Video Using VLC Media Player?

 _Posted by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last update: April 28, 2020_

How to rotate a video in VLC permanently? As an unprofessional photographer as i am, we quite enjoying shooting our digital camera and iPhone videos in a free style - portrait mode to landscape mode and back to protrait mode and on and on. The unconsidered frequent change of shooting modes can result in a big "OH, NO!" when you sit down and play back your recordings later on computers and TV sets. So, here we'd like to introduce you a quick method to   **rotate video using VLC media player**  the way you intended, both permanently and flexibly.

To let VLC rotate video, there are mainly two choices:   
[1\. Transform and rotate video according to given parameters >](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/)  
[2\. Rotate video according to your own angle preferences >](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/)

VLC has its own video rotation idea â€“ only rotate video display, but **video will be rotated permanently only within VLC.** After clicking "Save" button, VLC will remember the rotation angle preference permanently for this video, so that when you open the video next time, you do not have to make a second adjustment. However, this won't affect the video itself. Opening the video using [VLC alternatives](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) like Potplayer, GOMplayer, KMPlayer, the video will be played in its original mode rather than rotated version. 

**To thoroughly and permanently rotate a video**, we recommend you WinX or MacX video converter. That software allows you to loop the video and save it as the rotated way. [Click to learn how to rotate iPhone videos free](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) with MacX video converter.
