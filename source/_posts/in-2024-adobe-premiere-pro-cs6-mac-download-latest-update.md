## Video Speed Controllers: Best Software for Windows, Mac, and More

The volume of video information submitted to the Internet each day is mind-boggling, with individuals all over the world producing dozens of hours of film each day. Consequently, to achieve lots of views, comments, or likes on your social media videos, they must stand out in an ocean of content.

Slowing down or speeding up the film is a basic but powerful video editing technique that may make the stuff you post online more fascinating to watch. Continue reading to learn more about the Best Video Speed Changers for Windows and Mac in this article.

## Top 7 Best Video Speed Changers for Windows and Mac \[Free and Paid\]

Sharing raw videos you shoot with your smartphone with your fans and followers may not always provide the desired results. Slowing down the playback speed may make a scene more exciting or emphasize a crucial point in your film, while raising the playback speed of a video is an excellent choice for creating magnificent time-lapses.

Let's look at a few of the **best video speed changer software** for Windows and Mac for fast and slow-motion video editing.

### 1. Windows 10 Photos App

**Supported OS:** Windows

**Pricing:** Free to Use

Windows 10 comes with Microsoft Photos, a free picture viewer and editor that allows you to edit and improve photos while organizing and editing movies. Microsoft Photos has a touch-friendly interface and delivers excellent image editing and additions. Besides the basics, you get to change the speed of your video comfortably, accessing the in-built features with the lossless video quality.

To slow down or speed up a video clip in the storyboard, go to the "Storyboard" section and choose the video clip you want to slow down or accelerate. From the toolbar, choose the Speed button to accelerate. The speed of the clip may be adjusted by sliding the slider. Once you have completed the instructions, the video will begin to play at the speed that you specified.

![change video speed windows 10 photos app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-video-speed-windows-10-photos-app.jpg)

### 2. **iMovie**

The speed is set to 50% by default when you choose **Slow**, but you may change it by clicking any of the speed buttons. Accelerate the chosen segment of the video: Select Fast from the Speed pop-up option.

The speed is set at twice the standard pace (2x) by default when you choose **Fast**, but you may change it by clicking any of the speed buttons. To choose the speed, select Slow or Fast from the Speed pop-up menu and click a speed button. A slowed-down clip gets longer in the timeline, whereas a sped-up clip becomes shorter.

Splitting the video is done using the Split icon, which looks like a razor and can be found in the top menu, "Cutting and splitting" section. Simply position the timeline cursor where you want the fast-motion segment to begin and divide it there. Repeat to get to the finish of the piece.
