#### **No.2 NVIDIA SHIELD Digital Media Player**

**Device Price:**$199.99  
**Built-in Applications:** Access the entire Google Play Store  
**Remote Control:** Yes with extras control optional ($59.99)  
**Video Streaming Quality:** Up to 4K HDR

**Reviews:** This **digital media player** is probably the first and best for 4K HDR content - hence extremely suitable for customers picky about the scope of colors when watching videos from YouTube, Hulu, Netflix, and on top of all, games - NVIDIA is the best in category for PC-quality game streaming like GeForce NOW thanks of the NVIDIA GameStream technology: Games purchased (downloaded) from Google Play Store enjoy very smooth translation to this digital media player when connected to TV, providing game-console-like experience if you're to purchase this player for a family with game players and videophile.

#### **No.3 Chromecast Ultra**

**Device Price:**$69.99  
**Operating System:** Android  
**Built-in Applications:** Access Entire Google Play Store, no Amazon Instant Video support  
**Remote Control:** NO  
**Video Streaming Quality:** Up to 4K HDR content

**Reviews:** Another fast runner in 4K HDR video streaming is Google's top-of-the-line digital media player - Chromecast Ultra: Developed from its 2015 forerunner, this little gadget proves more streaming effective dished in the just-as-before lightweight built. Chromecastis invisible - when magnetically plugs in to the backend of your TV, it virtually works with all popular video streaming APP like YouTube, Vevo, ESPN , etc, with Amazon Instant Video an exception.

 Though saving you a few more than the rest of digital media players recommended in this page, Chromecast Ultra is the only one without a real remote.

#### **No.4 Amazon Fire TV (4K UHD Support Available)**

**Device Price:**$89.99  
**Operating System:** Android  
**Built-in Applications:** Over 10,000 apps available.  
**Remote Control:** Yes, with an extra Alexa Voice Remote.   
**Video Streaming Quality:** Up to 4K UHD

**Review**The classical Amazon Fire TV, with upgraded features than the $39.99 Fire TV Stick, virtually offers more stable streaming performance, and a sweet uplift to play 4K Ultra HD content. This digital player leaves a blank microSD slot in case you're thinking of expanding storage in the future, and it also leaves Bluetooth connectivity for Fire TV Game Controller if you're thinking of upgrading the equipment.   
**Tip:** Fire TV only connects to TV sets that support HDCP requirement, and you're suggested to check out the specs to see if it matches up with your TV.

#### **No.5 Roku Streaming Stick 3rd-Generation**

**Device Price:**$49.99  
**Built-in Applications:** Access the entire Google Play Store, Amazon Underground   
**Remote Control:** Yes   
**Video Streaming Quality:** Up to 1080p

**Review:**Throughout Roku's complete lineup of digital media players we've come to this 2016 new member - Roku Streaming Stick 3rd-gen, a cost-effective choice if you don't have a 4K TV display.  
Dongle or set-top box? Most customers come to this puzzle when first started to choose a digital media player, in that dongles virtually works less reliably than a robust smart TV box. But truth is Roku 3 works just as well as any streaming devices.

#### **No.6 SkyStream One Streaming Media Player**

**Device Price:**$149.99  
**Operating System:** Android  
**Built-in Applications:** Access the entire Google Play Store, Amazon Underground   
**Remote Control:** Yes   
**Video Streaming Quality:** Up to 4K UHD

**Review:**This brand-new gadget that only hit the shelf on February 2021 seems an inspiring and integrated solution for cord-cutters! The all-in support for Google Player Store and Amazon Underground excites us - honestly the largest profile among all digital media players available out there in the market, which means you can not only download Netflix, Hulu, HBO and Amazon Video for standard free online streaming, but also match up the extender with your existing cable service like WatchESPN, HBO GO, etc associated with the paid cable account. Developed by the XBMV/KODI team, SkyStream One is indeed a nice option for entertainment.
