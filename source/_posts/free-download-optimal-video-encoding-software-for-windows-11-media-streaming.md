Besides, it doesn't play the most common MP4 and MKV files very successfully when these media files are encoded with H.264, H.265 or any other incompatible codecs.

### Disadvantages of Windows 10 Video Codec Pack

These codec packs indeed help beef up your Windows Media Player to play multimedia files without troubles, but they are actually not that satisfying. 

Firstly, codec pack from unauthorized sites may contain **virus**, **adware** or **spyware** that will corrupt the operating system of your computer or leave some other potential risks to your PC. Secondly, the newly downloaded Windows 10 codec pack may **conflict with the existed codecs** on your PC. Thirdly, the third-party codec packs **doesn't update frequently**, so they may not be compatible with your Windows 10 media player. 

Though we have tested the above two codec packs for Windows 10, we are not 100% sure that they won't bring troubles to your Windows Media Player or computer in the future. So, we'd like to introduce a better way for you Windows 10 users to play videos encoded with different video codecs, say [video player for all formats](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/).
