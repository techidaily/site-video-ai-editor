SMPlayer is indeed an award-winning GUI, just like its competitors like KMPlayer, which also calls MPlayer as its powerhouse.

#### **★ Quirks Worth Knowing Before Downloading SMPlayer for Windows 10**

Whether or not you'll like the playback stability of SMPlayer for Windows 10 may vary: Now that it is the GUI front-end for MPlayer developed since 2006 (recently SMPlayer also added support for mpv), this interface calls MPlayer as a multimedia engine, which virtually plays all video formats in your archive: MP4, MKV, MOV, RMV, DVD, CD, etc. 

☆ **SMPlayer Windows 10 - One of the GUI front-end of MPlayer**

hat being said, SMPlayer is among the many GUI options based on MPlayer, other well-known names include KMPlayer, UMPlayer, etc., each with its distinctive features and graphic style. 

By the time you download SMPlayer Windows 10 from smplayer.sourceforge.net, it's not difficult to find the download package has a complete set of MPlayer installation pack included, wrapped-up by developers of this GUI which, for one thing, facilitates the use of SMPlayer so you don't need to download MPlayer alone, for another, increasing the possibility of this package going wrong: When I first tried to Install SMPlayer on a Windows 10 PC, the install wizard kept popping up a window warning error exists in its Qt5Gui.dll, and that installation can't carry on unless I abort this error.

**Qt5GUI.dll Missing When Installing SMPlayer**  
 What attributes to this problem? Can SMPlayer Windows 10 not working also happen to you?  
 Now that SMPlayer in itself is a sheer GUI relying on MPlayer as a kernel to function as a media player, any dll file missing from the installer you download can result in such problems.  
 However, you can stay away from this error by altering to 5KPlayer - the self-integrated, compact free multimedia player for Windows 10.

#### ☆**Automatic Subtitle Downloading in SMPlayer Windows 10**
 **\- Useful or Not?**

Intelligent subtitling options of SMPlayer may be the very reason for its wide popularity. Indeed, SMPlayer for Windows 10/8/7 backed-up the opensubtitles.org facilitates the 1-click search of movie subtitles to be fast and natural. But when the movies/videos you want to subtitle doesn't distribute its CC sources on this very platform, just like huffc 

**SMPlayer Subtitle Download Failed/Not Showing/Can't Find Subtitles**

_"I have no luck finding any subtitles with the SMPlayer Windows 10 subtitle search. But when I manually search on the opensubtitles.org website using a web browser, I can find some for a given file."_

The same happens to MarwiN, another user of SMPlayer Windows 7, which isn't very configurable in terms of its automatic subtitle searching function.

However, the free **5KPlayer** can be of great help when SMPlayer Windows 10 can't load subtitles, or SMPlayer subtitle download failed happens to you: It supports a wide variety of [subtitle sites](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) as http://www.moviesubtitles.org/, http://www.subscene.com/ and http://www.subtitles.hr/, offering abundant resources to choose from.  
 You can use it to easily add subtitles to videos in \*srt, \*ass, \*ssa, \*json, \*aqt, \*sub format, there's just no more worries if the subtitle not showing properly, for you can just rely on 5KPlayer. 

☆ **Intelligent SMPlayer Windows 10 - Resume Where You Left Off**

A small-but-sleek function we can't neglect in this MPlayer-based GUI is its "Resume playback of videos from where you left off". It is often the case when you need to put a movie aside for a while without remembering where it goes, then the intelligent SMPlayer Windows 10 remembers it for you, enabling you to jump into the scenario once you click open.
