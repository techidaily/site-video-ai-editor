## Best Hardware Accelerated Video Player Free Download

 _Posted by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last update: April 28, 2020_

With the best **hardware accelerated video player** listed here, you're able to play high-res videos and large files without crashes and accomplish other tasks in the background at the same time. The hardware acceleration technique in these kinds of media players will automatically switch choking CPU-only video rendering to high-efficient GPU-accelerated decoding for smooth AVC (H.264), HEVC (H.265), HD, HDR, 4K, 8K, etc. videos playback, which helps your processor go a little bit easier as well as ensures happy digital entertainment. So, just have a glimpse and choose the GPU-accelerated video player you prefer most.

### What is Hardware Acceleration?

Speaking of hardware acceleration, the difference of [software decoding and hardware decoding](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) is the priority to talk about:  
**Software decoding** – the first technique to play a video, software decodes the video and reads the information using CPU only.  
**Hardware decoding** – decodes videos faster by transferring the heavy decoding job to GPU that CPU is capable of doing so.  
 More specifically, high-res video decoding is an extremely CPU-occupying task that a computer with low-power CPU can't handle other tasks normally if the CPU is used to decode high definition videos. That is to say, your computer needs a helper – GPU that is able to do such heavy decoding jobs to allow CPU to concentrate on other duties to make computer work as smooth as usual during a smooth high-res video playback.

However, GPU won't work automatically as for [HD/UHD videos playback](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) unless you utilize a video player with hardware acceleration ability that can start up the GPU decoding process on your computer. And luckily, here is the place where GPU accelerated video player is provided.

##  Top 6 Hardware Accelerated Video Players
