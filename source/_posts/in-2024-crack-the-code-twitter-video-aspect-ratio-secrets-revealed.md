There will be two examples given for this, one for the straightforward **MP3 into MP4** conversion the other for the more specified **MP3 to MOV** conversion!

### 01How to Convert MP3 to MP4?

**Step 1: Launch MP3 to MP4 Convert (for Windows)**

For our example, we'll be using the **free MP3 to MP4 converter**, EaseUS Video Converter! This is open-source software, so you can use it for free!

To start using your chosen **free MP3 to MP4 converter**, upload the file that you want to convert! For our example converter, it's as simple as dragging and dropping your chosen MP3 into the interface (as pointed out in the image below.)

![Open Finished MP4 File](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%204.png)

### 02How to Convert MP3 to MOV?

We've also included how you can convert **MP3 to MOV** with the same tool! As you will surely see, much of the process is the same. Only one step is really changed!

**Step 1: Uploaded MP3 File!**

First, just like in the previous section, upload your MP3 file (by dragging and dropping the file onto the **MP3 to MOV** converter.)

![Choose Files for Upload](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%205.png)

**Step 2: Select 'MOV' Format!**

This is the step where things change, of course! Now, rather than choosing MP4, you should select the "MOV" format for your output type! This will ensure that your MP3 file is converted specifically to a MOV file.

![Select MOV output format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%206.png)

**Step 3: Convert!**

## Part 2 **Six Online and Free Mp3 to Mp4 Converter**

For this next section, we're going to introduce a couple of **online MP3 to MP4 converters** as well other general, paid, and **free MP3 to MP4 converters** that you can check out. A link to a video showing how the converter works, as well as brief descriptions for each converter, have also been provided to ensure that you have a good idea of how each one works!

### 01**[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

The first of the tools on this list is Filmora! Filmora, first and foremost, is an advanced video editor. Some might say that using it as a tool to simply convert **MP3 into MP4** is a little bit of an overkill.

But, chances are, you're not likely going to want to stop at converting your MP3 into an MP4 file anyway, right? Well, if that's the case, then having an all-in-one tool on your side that can offer you endless options for all sorts of purposes is one way to ensure that you are starting off on the right foot from the very beginning!

### 02Zamzar

Zamzar is a Windows 10 app that works as a general conversion tool. It doesn't just convert **MP3 into MP4** or **MP3 into MOV** — it also does the job if you're looking for a converter that will work on JPG to PNG or PDF to JPG, etc. That makes it a helpful tool to have on hand just for general conversion purposes.

### 03Online File Converter

Online File Converter, as you can probably guess from the name, is an online conversion tool! This tool, much like Zamzar, is a heavy-hitter when it comes to conversion inputs and outputs compatibility. So, not only are you able to do the general **MP3 into MP4** conversion promised today, but you can do other things as well! Plus, no download or installation is required! All you need is an internet connection to access the website the converter is on and a little patience while you wait to upload, convert, and download the file in question.

### 04Any Conv

AnyConv is an alternate to the Online File Converter if you're looking for an online solution, but you don't like the interface of one or the other. The two are pretty much identical in terms of features. All you need to do in order to use it is to upload the file that you want to convert, choose a format, and then download the output file when you're done!

### 05Uniconverter

Uniconverter is an online **MP3 to MP4** tool from Wondershare (the same creators of Filmora Pro). It's a very solid tool. And it's quite a convenient one too. Since, just like any online converter, all you need to start using it is an internet connection.

### 06MConverter - Chrome Extension

Our last pick brings us back to unique solutions! Specifically, we're delving into the realm of Chrome extensions! This tool, the MConverter, works similarly to the other converters on this list. But, of course, in this case, if you want to use it in order to convert your files, you must first download the plug-in to your Chrome browser!

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** Despite the variety of options out there for **MP3 into MP4** converters, they all pretty much work the same. First, you upload the file that you want to convert. Second, you select the output format for the conversion. And finally, third, you finish the conversion!

**●** Most MP3 to MP4 converters work for other formats as well. For example, if you want to convert your **MP3 to MOV** instead — that's possible! OR, if you want to do the opposite, and convert **MP4 to MP3**, that works too!

**●** The difference between the different audio-to-video converters is usually the type of extra features it comes with as well as from what platform you can use it. For the latter, there are software types that you download and install to your computer, online types that you access through the internet, and extensions that you plug into your browser! Pick the one that works best with your workflow.

All you need to do in order to use it is to upload the file that you want to convert, choose a format, and then download the output file when you're done!

### 05Uniconverter

Uniconverter is an online **MP3 to MP4** tool from Wondershare (the same creators of Filmora Pro). It's a very solid tool. And it's quite a convenient one too. Since, just like any online converter, all you need to start using it is an internet connection.

### 06MConverter - Chrome Extension

Our last pick brings us back to unique solutions! Specifically, we're delving into the realm of Chrome extensions! This tool, the MConverter, works similarly to the other converters on this list. But, of course, in this case, if you want to use it in order to convert your files, you must first download the plug-in to your Chrome browser!

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** Despite the variety of options out there for **MP3 into MP4** converters, they all pretty much work the same. First, you upload the file that you want to convert. Second, you select the output format for the conversion. And finally, third, you finish the conversion!

**●** Most MP3 to MP4 converters work for other formats as well. For example, if you want to convert your **MP3 to MOV** instead — that's possible! OR, if you want to do the opposite, and convert **MP4 to MP3**, that works too!

**●** The difference between the different audio-to-video converters is usually the type of extra features it comes with as well as from what platform you can use it. For the latter, there are software types that you download and install to your computer, online types that you access through the internet, and extensions that you plug into your browser! Pick the one that works best with your workflow.

There are even online **MP3 to MP4 converters** that will allow you to do this without having to download or install anything! But, we're getting ahead of ourselves here. Continue reading below to learn more:

02 [Six Online and Free Mp3 to Mp4 Converter](#Part 2)

## Part 1 **Easy Steps on Convert MP3 into MP4**

For the first part of this article, we'll be covering how to use a **free** **MP3 to MP4 converter** in order to successfully change the format of your audio into a video file! There will be two examples given for this, one for the straightforward **MP3 into MP4** conversion the other for the more specified **MP3 to MOV** conversion!

### 01How to Convert MP3 to MP4?

**Step 1: Launch MP3 to MP4 Convert (for Windows)**

For our example, we'll be using the **free MP3 to MP4 converter**, EaseUS Video Converter! This is open-source software, so you can use it for free!

To start using your chosen **free MP3 to MP4 converter**, upload the file that you want to convert! For our example converter, it's as simple as dragging and dropping your chosen MP3 into the interface (as pointed out in the image below.)

![Launch MP3 to MP4 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%201.png)

**Step 2: Choose Output Format!**

Once the MP3 file has been uploaded, choose your desired output format.

(For our example **MP3 to MP4 converter**, this means selecting the settings icon for the file in question and then choosing a format from the pop-up window that appears (shown in the image below).

![Choose MP4 Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%202.png)

**Step 3: Start Converting!**

Once you've chosen your desired output format (which in this case is **MP3 into MP4**), select the "CONVERT" button to finish up!

![Convert MP3 into MP4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%203.png)

**Step 4: Save MP3 Into MP4**

Depending on your chosen **free MP3 to MP4 converter**, your new MP4 file may have to be downloaded manually or not.

In the case of EaseUS Video Converter, it is downloaded automatically, all you have to do is select the "Finished" tab and select "OPEN" to go directly to the file location.

![Open Finished MP4 File](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%204.png)

### 02How to Convert MP3 to MOV?

We've also included how you can convert **MP3 to MOV** with the same tool! As you will surely see, much of the process is the same. Only one step is really changed!

**Step 1: Uploaded MP3 File!**

First, just like in the previous section, upload your MP3 file (by dragging and dropping the file onto the **MP3 to MOV** converter.)

![Choose Files for Upload](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%205.png)

**Step 2: Select 'MOV' Format!**

This is the step where things change, of course! Now, rather than choosing MP4, you should select the "MOV" format for your output type! This will ensure that your MP3 file is converted specifically to a MOV file.

![Select MOV output format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%206.png)

**Step 3: Convert!**

Again, just like before, select "CONVERT" to start the conversion process from **MP3 to MOV**!

![Select Conver or Convert All](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%207.png)

**Step 4: Open Folder to Find File!**

Then, finally, go to the "Finished" tab to find your new MOV file.

## Part 2 **Six Online and Free Mp3 to Mp4 Converter**

For this next section, we're going to introduce a couple of **online MP3 to MP4 converters** as well other general, paid, and **free MP3 to MP4 converters** that you can check out. A link to a video showing how the converter works, as well as brief descriptions for each converter, have also been provided to ensure that you have a good idea of how each one works!

### 01**[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

The first of the tools on this list is Filmora! Filmora, first and foremost, is an advanced video editor. Some might say that using it as a tool to simply convert **MP3 into MP4** is a little bit of an overkill.

But, chances are, you're not likely going to want to stop at converting your MP3 into an MP4 file anyway, right? Well, if that's the case, then having an all-in-one tool on your side that can offer you endless options for all sorts of purposes is one way to ensure that you are starting off on the right foot from the very beginning!

### 02Zamzar

Zamzar is a Windows 10 app that works as a general conversion tool. It doesn't just convert **MP3 into MP4** or **MP3 into MOV** — it also does the job if you're looking for a converter that will work on JPG to PNG or PDF to JPG, etc. That makes it a helpful tool to have on hand just for general conversion purposes.

### 03Online File Converter

Online File Converter, as you can probably guess from the name, is an online conversion tool! This tool, much like Zamzar, is a heavy-hitter when it comes to conversion inputs and outputs compatibility. So, not only are you able to do the general **MP3 into MP4** conversion promised today, but you can do other things as well! Plus, no download or installation is required! All you need is an internet connection to access the website the converter is on and a little patience while you wait to upload, convert, and download the file in question.

### 04Any Conv

AnyConv is an alternate to the Online File Converter if you're looking for an online solution, but you don't like the interface of one or the other. The two are pretty much identical in terms of features. All you need to do in order to use it is to upload the file that you want to convert, choose a format, and then download the output file when you're done!

#### 1. [GATM Meme Generator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=iddqd.gatm)

**Compatibility:** Android

![Meme Maker App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/GATM-meme-generator-android-app.jpg)

Besides being a powerful meme generator this app also offers an easy way to discover new memes. The browsable content is updated daily, so you'll always be in touch with the latest meme trends.

The app features a huge template library, and you can upload your own images too. The GATM Meme Generator can be downloaded for free, but the text formatting tools offer only basic options. All generated memes are watermark-free and they can be shared on Facebook, Twitter, or numerous other social media platforms directly from the app.

#### 2. [Mematic](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.trilliarden.mematic&hl=en)

**Compatibility:** Android, iOS

![Meme Maker App](<https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mematic> -the-meme-maker.jpg)

However, downloading Mematic for free will enable you to gain access to hundreds of classic meme pictures to which you can add your captions. The app's interface is intuitive so you won't have any problems making memes, even if you never used the Mematic app before.

#### 3. [Memedroid](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/memedroid-funny-memes-gifs/id549014460?mt=8)

Memedroid is both a meme generator and a community of people who enjoy a good laugh. It features a rich meme template library and just basic text tools. There are very few extra features other than support for uploading your own images and GIFs.

Despite this, the Memedroid app is a great source of new meme templates because the gallery is constantly updated. If you decide to install this app on your device, be prepared to deal with annoying ads on a regular basis. Don't be too surprised if the app crashes while you are browsing through the latest memes.

#### 4. [ZomboDroid's Meme Generator Free](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zombodroid.MemeGenerator&hl=en)

**Compatibility** **:** Android

![Meme Maker App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ZomboDroid-meme-generator-free.jpg)

Neatly organized memes into separate categories, stickers, excellent file sharing features, and memes without watermarks are only a few reasons why the Meme Generator Free app is so popular. As its name suggests, you don't have to pay anything to install the app and use its library that has over 700 memes.

You can choose the size of the header and footer, use a font you like, or crop images in just a few easy steps. The only unpleasant thing about this app is the ads because every other option makes the meme-generating process fun.

#### 5. [Tumblr](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tumblr)

**Compatibility:** iOS, Android

![Meme Maker App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tumblr-make-memes.jpg)

Tumblr is a social network, so you can create an account and post images and videos on your profile. The app for iPhones and Android Smartphones features a GIF editor as well as photo editing options. You can customize text by selecting the font, the size and the color or add as many stickers as you want to your memes.

Besides memes, you can use Tumblr to discover all types of images from pet photos to cars or fashion photos. All memes must be first posted to this social network before they can be shared on your other social media channels.

#### 6. [ZomboDroid's Video and GIF Memes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zombodroid.videogifmemefreegplay&hl=en)

**Compatibility:** Android

The coolest memes are always GIFs, and if you want a powerful app that lets you manipulate moving and still images then ZomboDroid's Video and GIF Memes is one of the best options.

Meme Creator lets you share memes on all popular online destinations, which makes it a great choice for all Android owners who post fresh content every day on multiple social media profiles.

#### 8. [Meme Producer](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/meme-producer-free-meme-maker-generator/id560797323?mt=8)

**Compatibility:** iOS

Share memes in three simple steps. Choose a picture, add a caption and share a meme on any popular social media platform. Meme Producer lets you combine several images in a single meme and enables you to change a caption with a single tap.

Captions generated with this app can have more than one line, which is great if the text you want to add contains more than two sentences. The app can be downloaded for free from the AppStore and it contains no ads or watermarks.

#### 9. [Modern Meme Maker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dinizthiagobrdev.ModernMemeMaker)

**Compatibility:** Android

The app lets you browse and use over 200 free meme templates. You just have to select the meme you like and decide which color or the size the text is going to be. You don't have to worry about the length of the caption because the multi-line feature is available.

If you want, you can add watermarks to memes, although watermarked memes are not particularly popular. The best part is that Modern Meme Maker supports Instagram's upload requirements, while it also lets you share memes on Twitter or Tumblr.

#### 10. [Make a Meme +](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/make-a-meme+/id513930217?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8)

**Compatibility:** iOS

With more than 4 million users and an extensively long list of memes, this app is among the very best meme generators for iPhones. Changing the text requires you to just tap on a meme you like, while you can also add faces or hats to images you're editing.

The text formatting tools are not as powerful as you'd expect from an app that offers so many other cool features. All images can either be saved to the camera roll or shared on Facebook, Instagram, and other popular online destinations.

---

#### **Conclusion:**

Making a meme is about imagination, and having a sense of humor, but you also need a powerful tool that lets you express your ideas in the exact way you want. A good meme generator app will help you forget about the technical side of the meme-making process so you can focus on what is truly important. What's your favorite meme generator app for iOS or Android devices? Wanna be more creative in making memes and level up your video editing experience, download Filmora for free and make memes and videos with fun.

If you want, you can add watermarks to memes, although watermarked memes are not particularly popular. The best part is that Modern Meme Maker supports Instagram's upload requirements, while it also lets you share memes on Twitter or Tumblr.

#### 10. [Make a Meme +](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/make-a-meme+/id513930217?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8)

**Compatibility:** iOS

With more than 4 million users and an extensively long list of memes, this app is among the very best meme generators for iPhones. Changing the text requires you to just tap on a meme you like, while you can also add faces or hats to images you're editing.

The text formatting tools are not as powerful as you'd expect from an app that offers so many other cool features. All images can either be saved to the camera roll or shared on Facebook, Instagram, and other popular online destinations.

#### **Conclusion:**

Making a meme is about imagination, and having a sense of humor, but you also need a powerful tool that lets you express your ideas in the exact way you want.
