There are two different versions of AMR: AMR-Narrowband (AMR-NB) and AMR-Wideband (AMR-WB), both of them are audio format that could be play by AMR player like 5KPlayer. AMR-NB (AMR or GSM-AMR) is mainly intended for use by GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), while AMR-WB by UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System). AMR-NB has a file extension like .amr or .3ga, and AMR-WB is .awb. For the container format, AMR-NB is as same as AMR-WB that is used in 3GP container format in 3GPP specifications.
