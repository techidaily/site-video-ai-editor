#### **VLC Player – Uncrown King of Media Players for Catalina/Big Sur**

![VLC Player](https://www.5kplayer.com/video-music-player/img/vlc-windows7.jpg) 

That VLC is the uncrowned king of multimedia field has been continuously challenged by many upspringing media players, yet its unshakable popularity stands still no matter how hard they try to struggle forward on whatever platforms. MacOS Catalina/Big Sur is one of the main tracks where those media players go head to head for the "best" title. Fiece as the competition is, we may still have to list VLC as the top media player for macOS Catalina/Big Sur in terms of technical horsepower and settings rather than appearance. 

**Features**:   
All format support  
Handle raw/incomplete materials   
Hardcore users' choice

#### **MPC-HC - Simple & Most Lightweight Media Player Catalina/Big Sur**

 Scarcely had VLC gained its fame, when MPC followed the footsteps. The reason why we think MPC-HC better than MPC-BE is that the former updates more frequently with in-time fixes and renewed library on a routine basis, which is convenient for users to give feedbacks and get solutions. Media Player Classic Home Cinema and MPC-BE frankly are almost in common from average users' perspective (see [which media player classic to download](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/)).

**Features**:  
Most Lightweight player of all  
Highly configurable
