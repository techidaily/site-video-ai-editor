![Best FLAC Player for macOS - Winamp](https://www.5kplayer.com/video-music-player/img/winamp.png)

**2\. Winamp – Mac FLAC Player Old Head** 

Winamp is renowned for its open to plug-ins and hacktastic tweaking as well as light-weight as a Mac FLAC music player. While iTunes has become a swollen resource hog, Winamp remains light-weight and fast. You can run it well on virtually any macOS. Winamp also supports Syncing over Wi-Fi, built-in internet radio, CD ripping and other assorted plug-ins for absurdly specific uses.

Sadly, Winamp Version 5.666 is its last release, which means that you won't get further supports and bug fixes using Winamp when you encounter any major playback issues in the future.

**3\. Vox – Versatile FLAC Player for Mac** 

Vox Player is probably a good FLAC player to try considering its minimalist design. Not only does it support FLAC playback, but it plays high-resolution audio files – up to 4x deeper sound resolution. Other supported popular formats include ALAC, DSD, PCM, APE, and M4A. This Mac FLAC player also supports YouTube streaming, built-in internet radio, music browsing, searching, music management, personalization, SoundCloud and Last.FM connecting.

**4\. Clementine – Out-of-box macOS FLAC Player**

This nifty application, based on Qt4, can be your closest option. music management: cover manager, queue manager, playlist management tools, music format transcoder (with FLAC support), CD ripping tool, and tag editor for batch music editing. This FLAC player for macOS also integrates with tons of varied internet services and music streaming services like Spotify, SoundCloud, Last.FM, to name a few. However, though you can tweak the appearance a bit, but nothing major so you're stuck with the clunky default interface.
