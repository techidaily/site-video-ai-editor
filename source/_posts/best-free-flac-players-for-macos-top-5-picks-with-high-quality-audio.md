While iTunes has become a swollen resource hog, Winamp remains light-weight and fast. You can run it well on virtually any macOS. Winamp also supports Syncing over Wi-Fi, built-in internet radio, CD ripping and other assorted plug-ins for absurdly specific uses.

Sadly, Winamp Version 5.666 is its last release, which means that you won't get further supports and bug fixes using Winamp when you encounter any major playback issues in the future.

**3\. Vox – Versatile FLAC Player for Mac**

This Mac FLAC player also supports YouTube streaming, built-in internet radio, music browsing, searching, music management, personalization, SoundCloud and Last.FM connecting.

This FLAC player for macOS also integrates with tons of varied internet services and music streaming services like Spotify, SoundCloud, Last.FM, to name a few. However, though you can tweak the appearance a bit, but nothing major so you're stuck with the clunky default interface.
