####

#### 1. Cut MP4 Video

To cut your MP4 video into certain parts, drag and drop the video on the Timeline and highlight it. Then place the red Time Indicator to where you want to cut the video, and click the Scissor button above the timeline.

After that, move the red marker to the end of the scene, and repeat this again to cut the video into several fragments. If you want to cut off the unwanted parts, right click the video and choose "Delete".

![export edited MP4 by cutting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cut-a-section.gif)

#### 2. Join MP4 Video

To join several MP4 video files into one, you just need to place all the video files on the timeline, adjust the order and hit "Create" to export it.

If you want to make the joined videos look like a really intact movie, just add transitions between clips for smooth change from one to next. To do this, click "Transition" tab on the main screen. Then drag the effect you like to the timeline to apply.

If you don't want to choose the transition one by one, let the software choose the transition randomly by right clicking and selecting "Random to All" option.

## How to Easily Edit MP4 Video?

Before we proceed to illustrate every detail on how to edit the MP4 video, you can download the MP4 editor first so you can follow the below steps one by one.

It's free to download now.

[![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

####

#### 1. Cut MP4 Video

To cut your MP4 video into certain parts, drag and drop the video on the Timeline and highlight it. Then place the red Time Indicator to where you want to cut the video, and click the Scissor button above the timeline.

After that, move the red marker to the end of the scene, and repeat this again to cut the video into several fragments. If you want to cut off the unwanted parts, right click the video and choose "Delete".

![export edited MP4 by cutting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cut-a-section.gif)

####

#### 2. Join MP4 Video

To join several MP4 video files into one, you just need to place all the video files on the timeline, adjust the order and hit "Create" to export it.

If you want to make the joined videos look like a really intact movie, just add transitions between clips for smooth change from one to next. To do this, click "Transition" tab on the main screen. Then drag the effect you like to the timeline to apply.

If you don't want to choose the transition one by one, let the software choose the transition randomly by right clicking and selecting "Random to All" option.

#### 3. Edit the audio of MP4 Video

Sometimes you may need to adjust the settings of audio. To do it, double click the video on the Timeline. Then a editing panel will pop up. Switch to the Audio column and you can easily change the Speed, Volume, Pitch of the audio file or add the Fade in/out effect to it.

Just highlight your MP4 video, right click and choose "Audio Detach". The audio file of your video will immediately be separated and appear on the music timeline. Since it is separated from the video, you can easily delete the audio track or replace it with your own music.
