## Part 1 Key Facebook Cover Video Specifications

A Facebook cover video works like a mini-advertisement that is played on a loop continuously. To keep the visitors engaged and interested in the video, the video needs to look neat, clean, bright and in the right size and the aspect ratio to fit perfectly in the given space. Key specifications for the cover video are enlisted below.

**Video cover Facebook size**: As such, there are no specific size guidelines issues but it is recommended to keep the size of the video less than 1.75GB. The small size will ensure that users having slower browsing speed can also watch the video in a hassle-free manner.

Dimensions of the video: A video to be used as a cover should be at least 820 X 312 pixels and to get the optimum results it is suggested to keep it around 820 X 462 pixels. If you will watch the video on a desktop, it will be cropped from the sides, or the top or bottom. Thus, to ensure that the video looks perfect on a phone as well as desktop keep the aspect ratio at 16:9 and place the important text or other content at the center.

File type of the video: Videos in MP4 or MOV format are suggested to be used as the cover video and their resolution should be a maximum of 1080p.

Duration of the video: A Facebook cover video can be between 20 seconds to 90 seconds and you can also choose to play it on a loop.

## Part 1 Part 1: Typical Aspect Ratios and Sizes of Screens and Videos

An aspect ratio is a measurement representing the ratio between the width and height of a screen or a video. It determines the length of your video or screen. Not only screens and videos, but you can use the concept also in images.

And, it is written as 'x:y' where 'x' is the width and 'y' is the height.

There isn't any one-size-fits-all when we need to use the video aspect ratios. Aspect ratios are generally selected based on where the video will post, how it will be visible, and what aim it usually serves.

Videos utilized for social media will vary from trailers shows or movies shown in theaters. There are common aspect ratios for modern televisions, but broadcasters can consider using the aspect ratio that operates great with their audience and content.

Since most videos showcase through standard online video platforms, custom aspect ratios are not commonly used.

Here are a few standard aspect ratios that you can use for live streaming and other video creation:

![aspect ratios](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-5-aspect-ratio-calculator-online-2.jpg)

**16:9**

A 16:9 aspect ratio represents a wide rectangle. It is also called "1.71:1," the most accessible form of the ratio, mathematically speaking.

This ratio is mainly used in video creation and streaming and is considered the international standard format for cinema and television.

Many also tend to use this highly famous aspect ratio on their sites.

It is also more cost-effective to use screens compatible with this ratio instead of their predecessors. The standardization of computer monitors and televisions saved producers both the money and time spent in the research field.

One of the ideal resolutions you can use with a 16:9 aspect ratio is 4Kor 3840 pixels by 2160 pixels.

**1:1**

The 1:1 video aspect ratio is one of the ideal squares used with square television sets.

It is much less in demand but usually visible on social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram.

Many cameras still have a square setting even though it's not the most commonly used aspect ratio.

**4:3**

The 4:3 aspect ratio was the general screen size for computer monitors and televisions before 16:9 and 16:10\. The reason for the switch was the HDTV birth. It's because the 16:9 and 16:10 aspect ratios allow for better resolutions than 4:3 do.

This aspect ratio was still considered for Apple iPads until they released the 2018 iPad Pro.

**3:2**

The 3:2 aspect ratio was primarily seen in classic 35 mm still photography still used on tablets, laptops, and various game consoles in the handheld form.

Many micro- to medium-sized cameras still use the 3:2 aspect ratio settings, but broadcasters rarely use it today.

**21:9**

The 21:9 aspect ratios have a pretty specific purpose. It is often called cinematic widescreen or ultra-widescreen.

It is also helpful for films with an anamorphic format. Anamorphic format videos create an optical illusion that offers a 360-degree view.

You are likely to look for the videos with this aspect ratio in notable museums, theme parks, theaters, and the like.

**9:16**

A 9:16 aspect ratio is for tall videos. This aspect ratio became famous after the launch of smartphones with video capabilities.

For instance, the optimal measure for an Instagram story is 1080 px by 1920 px, and thus its ratio comes out as 9:16\. The same goes for other famous apps with "story" features, including Snapchat and Facebook.

This makes sense because the iPhone camera's video setting can record footage in both 16:9 and 9:16.

## Part 2 How Do I Know the Aspect Ratio of My Video?

![aspect ratios](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-5-aspect-ratio-calculator-online-3.jpg)

Most cameras with video capabilities are available with various aspect ratio settings. This helps you decide which aspect ratio you'd like your video to have before recording it.

If you are looking to determine the aspect ratio of a video already shot, you can easily access additional information for the file.

The information button is a small "i" in a circle on Mac. Move on to right-click a file and select "**Properties**" on your PC.

It may give you the actual width and height of the video, but you can divide the two to find the aspect ratio.

02 [How Do I Know the Aspect Ratio of My Video?](#Part 2)

03 [How Can I Change the Aspect Ratio of an Image Online?](#Part 3)

04 [How to Change the Aspect Ratio in Filmora/Filmora Pro?](#Part 4)

## Part 1 Part 1: Typical Aspect Ratios and Sizes of Screens and Videos

An aspect ratio is a measurement representing the ratio between the width and height of a screen or a video. It determines the length of your video or screen. Not only screens and videos, but you can use the concept also in images.

And, it is written as 'x:y' where 'x' is the width and 'y' is the height.

There isn't any one-size-fits-all when we need to use the video aspect ratios. Aspect ratios are generally selected based on where the video will post, how it will be visible, and what aim it usually serves.

Videos utilized for social media will vary from trailers shows or movies shown in theaters. There are common aspect ratios for modern televisions, but broadcasters can consider using the aspect ratio that operates great with their audience and content.

Since most videos showcase through standard online video platforms, custom aspect ratios are not commonly used.

Here are a few standard aspect ratios that you can use for live streaming and other video creation:

![aspect ratios](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-5-aspect-ratio-calculator-online-2.jpg)

**16:9**

A 16:9 aspect ratio represents a wide rectangle. It is also called "1.71:1," the most accessible form of the ratio, mathematically speaking.

This ratio is mainly used in video creation and streaming and is considered the international standard format for cinema and television.

Many also tend to use this highly famous aspect ratio on their sites.

It is also more cost-effective to use screens compatible with this ratio instead of their predecessors. The standardization of computer monitors and televisions saved producers both the money and time spent in the research field.

One of the ideal resolutions you can use with a 16:9 aspect ratio is 4Kor 3840 pixels by 2160 pixels.

**1:1**

The 1:1 video aspect ratio is one of the ideal squares used with square television sets.

It is much less in demand but usually visible on social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram.

Many cameras still have a square setting even though it's not the most commonly used aspect ratio.

**4:3**

The 4:3 aspect ratio was the general screen size for computer monitors and televisions before 16:9 and 16:10\. The reason for the switch was the HDTV birth. It's because the 16:9 and 16:10 aspect ratios allow for better resolutions than 4:3 do.

This aspect ratio was still considered for Apple iPads until they released the 2018 iPad Pro.

**3:2**

The 3:2 aspect ratio was primarily seen in classic 35 mm still photography still used on tablets, laptops, and various game consoles in the handheld form.

Many micro- to medium-sized cameras still use the 3:2 aspect ratio settings, but broadcasters rarely use it today.

**21:9**

The 21:9 aspect ratios have a pretty specific purpose. It is often called cinematic widescreen or ultra-widescreen.

It is also helpful for films with an anamorphic format. Anamorphic format videos create an optical illusion that offers a 360-degree view.

You are likely to look for the videos with this aspect ratio in notable museums, theme parks, theaters, and the like.

**9:16**

A 9:16 aspect ratio is for tall videos. This aspect ratio became famous after the launch of smartphones with video capabilities.

For instance, the optimal measure for an Instagram story is 1080 px by 1920 px, and thus its ratio comes out as 9:16\. The same goes for other famous apps with "story" features, including Snapchat and Facebook.

This makes sense because the iPhone camera's video setting can record footage in both 16:9 and 9:16.

## Part 2 How Do I Know the Aspect Ratio of My Video?

![aspect ratios](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-5-aspect-ratio-calculator-online-3.jpg)

Most cameras with video capabilities are available with various aspect ratio settings. This helps you decide which aspect ratio you'd like your video to have before recording it.

If you are looking to determine the aspect ratio of a video already shot, you can easily access additional information for the file.

The information button is a small "i" in a circle on Mac. Move on to right-click a file and select "**Properties**" on your PC.

It may give you the actual width and height of the video, but you can divide the two to find the aspect ratio.

However, you don't need to hassle as we'll enlist the best five **aspect ratio** **calculators online** below.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

It is hard to believe that in 2024 Google Play had just fifty apps since it currently offers 2.8 million applications that can be used for anything from photo and [video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to learning a new language.

This year Google Play had a difficult task of selecting the best app of 2024, as there are so many apps across different categories that are worthy of this award.

So without further ado let’s take a look at the best and most popular Android apps of 2024

## The Best App of 2024 Selected by Google Play: [Ablo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=live.ablo&hl=en)

Language barriers can prevent us from exploring the world and experiencing different cultures. So, it is no wonder that an app that enables its users to talk to people from around the globe in their mother tongue was chosen as the best app of 2024 by Google Play.

![ 
Ablo: Make new friends from all over the world ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ablo-chat-app-best-app-google-play.jpg)

If you are traveling often and looking for an easy way to encounter the local culture or you just want to communicate with people whose language you don’t understand, then you should install Ablo and start making friends around the world.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

It is hard to believe that in 2024 Google Play had just fifty apps since it currently offers 2.8 million applications that can be used for anything from photo and [video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to learning a new language.

This year Google Play had a difficult task of selecting the best app of 2024, as there are so many apps across different categories that are worthy of this award. On December 3rd Google Play announced its choice and also presented the best Android apps of 2024 that were selected by users. So without further ado let’s take a look at the best and most popular Android apps of 2024

## The Best App of 2024 Selected by Google Play: [Ablo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=live.ablo&hl=en)

Language barriers can prevent us from exploring the world and experiencing different cultures. So, it is no wonder that an app that enables its users to talk to people from around the globe in their mother tongue was chosen as the best app of 2024 by Google Play.

![ 
Ablo: Make new friends from all over the world ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ablo-chat-app-best-app-google-play.jpg)

Ablo translates all chat messages in real-time which enables you to talk with all likeminded people you meet even if you don’t speak the same language.

The app also translates video calls live and allows you to have meaningful conversations with friends that come from different parts of the world. If you are traveling often and looking for an easy way to encounter the local culture or you just want to communicate with people whose language you don’t understand, then you should install Ablo and start making friends around the world.

## The Most Popular Apps of 2024 on Google Play

Smartphones bring entertainment to the palms of our hands and grant us instant access to information that makes our lives easier. Over the course of 2024 apps from a broad range of categories have sparked the interest of thousands of Android users. Here are some of the most popular apps of 2024 that can help you improve your productivity or make better fashion choices.

### 1\. [Peloton](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onepeloton.callisto&hl=en)

**Price:**Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Supported OS:**Requires Android 5.1 or up

**Category:**Health & Fitness

![InShot Video Editor - Glitch Video Effects ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/peloton-most-popular-app-android.jpg)

Leading a healthy lifestyle is much easier if you have the assistance of the world’s leading instructors. If you already own a Peloton bike or tread, then you can enjoy all the benefits of the Peloton app for free. Yoga, cardio or indoor cycling are just a few among numerous types of classes you can attend through this Android app. In addition, you can also broadcast your workouts through the Peloton’s Chromecast support and share your daily workout routines with thousands of followers. Even so, the app’s interface is somewhat outdated and the app crashes easily during workouts, which makes using Peloton frequently a bit difficult.

### 2\. [21 Buttons](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android21buttons&hl=en)

**Price:**Free

**Supported OS:**Requires Android 5.0 or up

This social network for fashion enthusiasts can help you choose new outfits and save them in your public or private closets. What’s more, you can share the fashion choices with your followers and link to the stores where particular items can be purchased.

Managing and organizing vast amounts of handwritten notes is a futile effort as sorting out hundreds of tiny pieces of paper is often impossible. Installing the Post-it app that captures handwritten notes and allows you to organize them in any way you want can help you perform your daily tasks more efficiently. Once you’ve created and organized your board you can share it with your colleagues or export it to Excel, PowerPoint or Trello. Post-it can capture more than 200 notes at the same time using your phone’s camera and use the Handwriting Recognition AI to transcribe them. Each not you create with this app can be easily edited or deleted.
