A video’s size can sometimes be a huge problem, as most [online video editing tools](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), file conversion platforms, and social media networks have video size limits. Even though the WebM file format is created with the aim of [reducing a video’s size](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), while maintaining the image quality, WebM videos can still be too large for the platform to which you want to upload them.

Luckily, you don’t have to spend hundreds of dollars on [professional video editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) just so you can resize a WebM video since there are lots of online WebM video compressors you can use for free. That’s why in this article we are going to introduce you to some of the best online WebM video compressors.

## How to Compress WebM Videos Online for Free

Before choosing an online WebM [video compressor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you should first examine the list of features the compressor you are interested in offers. In addition, you should also pay attention to the platform’s **file size limits**, since it can easily happen that the video you want to compress exceeds its limits. Let’s take a look at some of the best online WebM video compressors.

### 2\. PS2PDF

**Price:** Free

![compress WebM with PS2PDF](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/compress-webm-with-ps2pdf.jpg)

This versatile file conversion platform also offers the video compression features which enables you to shrink your WebM videos with ease. PS2PDF allows you to upload files from Dropbox, Google Drive or your computer and it lets you compress multiple WebM videos at the same time. After the upload process is completed, you can decide if you want to use VP8 or VP9 video codec and choose if the file’s size is going to be reduced by a percentage, preset quality or by using variable bitrates. In addition, you can choose the method that is going to be used to resize your WebM videos or select one of the available output dimension options. Click on the Compress Now button when ready and then proceed to download the resized file to your computer.

### 3\. Clideo

**Price:** Free, pricing plans start at $6.00 per month

![compress WebM with Clideo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/compress-webm-with-clideo.jpg)

Clideo is an online video editing platform that offers a broad range of tools you can use to cut, rotate, merge or compress video files that are saved in commonly used file formats. All you need to do in order to compress a WebM video with Clideo is to upload the file to the platform. The compression process is automatic, so you don’t have to adjust the compression settings. After the WebM video is resized you can save it to your Dropbox or Google Drive accounts or download it to your computer. All videos you compress with the free version of Clideo are going to be watermarked and you must purchase one of the available subscription models if you want to remove the watermark.

### 4\. Compress.com

**Price:** Free

![Compress WebM video in Compress.com](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/compress-webm-in-compress.jpg)

As its name suggests this is a file compression platform that enables its users to resize websites, documents, images, and audio or video files. You can compress up to five WebM videos that can have a maximum size of 200MB at the same time. The platform lets you choose if you want to change overall video quality or specified video parameters, so you should select the second option if you would like to customize the size, bitrate, frame rate and aspect ratio options. Additionally, you can click on the remove all audio tracks checkbox if you don’t want your compressed WebM video to contain sound. The resized WebM video is going to be displayed in the Output Files section of the screen and you just have to click on it if you would like to download it.

### 5\. Compressify

**Price:** Free

![Compress WebM with Compressify](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/compressify-compress-webm-video.jpg)

Reducing a video’s size with Compressify requires a minimum amount of effort because you just have to upload a WebM video and the platform will do the rest for you. However, the maximum size of a video file you can compress with this online tool is limited to just 8MB which makes it a good choice only if you are compressing short WebM videos. Compressify reduces the size of your video files by 60% while maintaining excellent image quality. Even though the size of WebM videos you upload to this platform cannot exceed 8MB, the file compression process is incredibly slow.

### 6\. ClipChamp

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $14.00 per month

![Compress WebM video with Clipchamp](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clipchamp-compress.jpg)

ClipChamp is a video editing platform that helps video content creators produce videos they post on social media.

You must be signed in to ClipChamp in order to use the platform’s video compression features. There are no video size limits which means that you can even resize WebM videos larger than 10GB. ClipChamp lets you choose the resolution, file format and quality of the output video file before starting the compression process. How much time ClipChamp is going to need to resize your WebM video depends on the video’s duration and its size.

### 7\. Online Converter

**Price:** Free

![Compress WebM with onlineconverter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/onlineconverter-compress-video.jpg)

You can reduce a file’s size in just three easy steps with this file conversion platform. You just have to select the source from which you want to upload a WebM video to Online Converter, insert the size to which you want to compress the video into the Desired Video Size box and select the audio quality option that best fits your needs. When ready click on the Compress button, and wait for the process to be completed. A new page will load after the WebM video is compressed and you should click on the Download Now option to save the resized file to your computer.

**Conclusion**

Resizing a WebM or any other type of video file is a simple task that doesn’t require you to have advanced video editing skills. In fact, most online WebM compressors enable you to shrink videos in just a few easy steps. Even so, some online video compressors limit the size of WebM videos you can upload to them, which can prevent you from using them to reduce the size of your videos. Which online WebM video compressor do you like to use the most? Leave a comment and let us know.

## Effortless GoPro Video Editing: A Step-by-Step Guide

# The Free and Easy Way to Edit GoPro HD Videos

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

One of the best benefits of GoPro HD videos is that they are encoded in an MPEG4 formats. There are a lot of different options for editing these files but they cost money. Depending on your situation though, you may be able to edit your files with a program that is free and easy to use.

* [Things to Consider When Editing Your GoPro HD Videos](#consideration)
* [Choosing the Right Software Package for Your Go Pro project](#choosing)

## Things to Consider When Editing Your GoPro HD Videos

If you are thinking about using one of the free GoPro HD video editors, you should take the following points into consideration.

#### 1\. All videos shot with GoPro HD will be in an MP4 format

This means you will need to find software that is will be able to import these kinds of files. Make sure you look up the specifications for all of the programs you consider to make sure the one you pick can handle the GoPro format.

#### 2\. Consider what kind of editing you are going to do with the file

Most free programs make it really easy to do basic editing, but you are going to need to pay for a program if you want to do any heavy duty editing. Make sure you carefully read the features before you download it to make sure you have what you are need to complete your editing. Also, some programs are only free for personal use, so if you need a program for business purposes you are probably going to have to pay a fee.

#### 3\. Consider the output formats

You will need to check out the different output formats that are available with the free software. If you plan to share the video over social media, make sure that the editing software includes that as an option. If you would like to burn the video to a DVD, make sure that the program is capable of writing to a disc.

## Choosing the Right Software Package for Your GoPro Project

Once you are through considering these different points, you can start looking at the different free and easy editing software available. Here are a few suggestions based on how much editing you want to do.

#### 1 _Just the Basics_

There are more options available if you only need to do basic editing, like cutting the length of the video, joining different parts together, or adding music. The following are three of the best programs to handle basic video editing of MP4 files.

* **Windows Movie Maker** is a basic Windows program that makes it really easy to manage basic editing, like adding music to one of your favorite videos.
* **VLC Media Player** is a neat little open-source program that works across different platforms for very basic use.
* **Animoto** is great for joining together several different videos, although only the Lite account is free and has a number of restrictions.

#### 2 _A Robust Program_

If you want something robust and effective, the best option is Wondershare Filmora. It lets you do more than just basic editing, allowing you to work with a number of different video formats. Once you download it, you will find that it is very user-friendly from the onset. Best of all, you can share videos from the program, something that the basic editors won’t let you do without paying for that ability.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Magix Movie Edit Pro 2015 Plus** excels in areas of advanced features, formats supported and attractive interface. However, it loses points for slow rendering performance and some complexity in the interface. The low price makes the exchange worth it for many users.

## Conclusion

GoPro HD videos are an incredibly popular format, but it is a bit more of a challenge to find a free editing program that will work with these files. Many free or lite versions of packages let you do very basic editing, but they come with a lot of restrictions and want you to spend money to upgrade it. If you want something that’s easy to use and performs well, Wondershare Filmora is an ideal choice.

**Magix Movie Edit Pro 2015 Plus** excels in areas of advanced features, formats supported and attractive interface. However, it loses points for slow rendering performance and some complexity in the interface. The low price makes the exchange worth it for many users.

## Conclusion

GoPro HD videos are an incredibly popular format, but it is a bit more of a challenge to find a free editing program that will work with these files. Many free or lite versions of packages let you do very basic editing, but they come with a lot of restrictions and want you to spend money to upgrade it. If you want something that’s easy to use and performs well, Wondershare Filmora is an ideal choice.

Make sure you carefully read the features before you download it to make sure you have what you are need to complete your editing.
