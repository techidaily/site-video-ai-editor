_“How good is CyberLink PowerDirector when it comes to automatic color matching?”_

CyberLink is one of the best video editors with features including motion tracking, screen recording, Multicam editing, etc. It further consists of tools such as titles, transitions, and effects to use quickly. However, we need to talk here about the **PowerDirector color match** process and assess its easiness. No matter how good a video editor is, the process must be simple to understand for the primary users. So, let’s begin with the step-by-step guide on how to color match different video clips in PowerDirector.

The Color Match feature of CyberLink PowerDirector allows matching tones and colors on selected video clips.

## Part 1: How to Color Match Different Video Clips in PowerDirector?

Applying color match/color correction to different clips at the same time also speeds up your workflow.

**Step 1: Download ColorDirector**

The first step to effectively do color matching in CyberLink PowerDirector is to download the ColorDirector. It contains a real camera and color effects to achieve cinematic color match editing.

**Step 2: Apply Presets to multiple clips on singletrack**

We assume that you already have clips imported into the timeline. Thus, do a left-click on the first clip, select **Fix/Enhance** tab, and then choose **ColorDirector** in the preview window.

**Step 3: Make manual adjustments**

Yes, you are required to make manual adjustments by clicking the **Manual** and **Adjustments** tab in the preview window.

You can now make some adjustments to **RGB Channel**, as here we have made it a little darker.

After you’re over with the manual adjustment, click **Back** to go back to the PowerDirector. Now, you can see that an adjustment is made to the selected clip.

Then, you need to click **Apply to All** and see the effect getting added to all the clips on the same track.

**Step 4: Apply color match adjustments at different tracks**

Again, apply the same process by left-clicking the video clip on a different track. Select **Fix/Enhance** and then go to **Color Director**.

Now, make some adjustments to the **RBG Channel** as we have made it a little brighter here. Then, you need to save this adjustment as Preset to apply to multiple clips simultaneously on different tracks. Hit the **Create** \> **Preset** tab as shown in the image below.

Then, you can name the **Preset** and hit on **Save** tab.

After you go back to the PowerDirector, you can see your recently-saved preset in the **Presets** list.

Now, select multiple clips. Left-click on a clip, hold the **Ctrl** key, then left-click on another clip while holding the **Ctrl** key, and so on. You will be able to choose more than one clip in this manner.

Then, check the **Color Presets/CLUTs** tab and select the **Preset** that you have saved to apply on multiple clips simultaneously on different tracks.

So, these were the steps of **PowerDirector color match** manual adjustments. We have only adjusted **RGB Channel**, but there are many others to look for and consider.

## Part 2: An Easier Solution to Automatically Matching the Color of Video Footage

Got confused by manual adjustments? There is an alternative solution if you also hate the manual process of color adjustments in CyberLink PowerDirector. Go no far than the professional yet beginner-friendly [**Wondershare Filmora**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to check in for automatic color match adjustments. Yes, you don't have to go for separate adjustments in RGB Channel, etc., as you have done before.

The Wondershare Filmora is also one of the most considerable video editors in the professional industry. It comes with pretty intuitive advanced editing tools such as **Video Stabilization**, **Color Tuning**, **Color Matching**, **Green Screen**, **Key** **Framing**, and **Motion Tracking,** etc., to name a few.

[![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Without further ado, let’s note down the automatic color match process in Wondershare Filmora as follows.

### Steps for Automatic Color Matching Different Video Clips in Wondershare Filmora

**Step 1: Download Wondershare Filmora**

Firstly, tap the **Try It Free** button to download Wondershare Filmora and proceed with the installation.

**Step 2: Import media files**

Then, import media files. We have imported two stock footage with different color schemes, as shown below.

**Step 3: Apply Color Match**

Double-click the footage over the timeline and head to the **Color** panel, as shown in the screenshot below. Then, select the **Color Match** option.

Turn on the **Comparison View** and move the slider given in the preview section. To match color settings, click on **Match** and wait a few seconds to let it see the same in both the **Reference** and **Current** preview window.

So, this is all you need to do as an alternative for the **PowerDirector color match**. The color match settings in Wondershare Filmora are relatively automatic and do not require additional RGB Channels adjustments.

## Conclusion

After discussing the steps on the **PowerDirector color match** process, we’d now like to mention our final words.

Then, you can name the **Preset** and hit on **Save** tab.

After you go back to the PowerDirector, you can see your recently-saved preset in the **Presets** list.

Now, select multiple clips. Left-click on a clip, hold the **Ctrl** key, then left-click on another clip while holding the **Ctrl** key, and so on. You will be able to choose more than one clip in this manner.

Then, check the **Color Presets/CLUTs** tab and select the **Preset** that you have saved to apply on multiple clips simultaneously on different tracks.

So, these were the steps of **PowerDirector color match** manual adjustments. We have only adjusted **RGB Channel**, but there are many others to look for and consider.

## Part 2: An Easier Solution to Automatically Matching the Color of Video Footage

Got confused by manual adjustments? There is an alternative solution if you also hate the manual process of color adjustments in CyberLink PowerDirector. Go no far than the professional yet beginner-friendly [**Wondershare Filmora**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to check in for automatic color match adjustments. Yes, you don't have to go for separate adjustments in RGB Channel, etc., as you have done before.

The Wondershare Filmora is also one of the most considerable video editors in the professional industry. It comes with pretty intuitive advanced editing tools such as **Video Stabilization**, **Color Tuning**, **Color Matching**, **Green Screen**, **Key** **Framing**, and **Motion Tracking,** etc., to name a few.

Without further ado, let’s note down the automatic color match process in Wondershare Filmora as follows.

### Steps for Automatic Color Matching Different Video Clips in Wondershare Filmora

**Step 1: Download Wondershare Filmora**

Firstly, tap the **Try It Free** button to download Wondershare Filmora and proceed with the installation.

**Step 2: Import media files**

Then, import media files. We have imported two stock footage with different color schemes, as shown below.

**Step 3: Apply Color Match**

Double-click the footage over the timeline and head to the **Color** panel, as shown in the screenshot below. Then, select the **Color Match** option.

Turn on the **Comparison View** and move the slider given in the preview section. To match color settings, click on **Match** and wait a few seconds to let it see the same in both the **Reference** and **Current** preview window.

So, this is all you need to do as an alternative for the **PowerDirector color match**. The color match settings in Wondershare Filmora are relatively automatic and do not require additional RGB Channels adjustments.

## Conclusion

After discussing the steps on the **PowerDirector color match** process, we’d now like to mention our final words. To find the easy, effective, and time-saving method, you should first consider the length of steps above in both sections. After the small analysis, you can check up on your favorite way of color matching.

_“How good is CyberLink PowerDirector when it comes to automatic color matching?”_

CyberLink is one of the best video editors with features including motion tracking, screen recording, Multicam editing, etc. It further consists of tools such as titles, transitions, and effects to use quickly. However, we need to talk here about the **PowerDirector color match** process and assess its easiness. No matter how good a video editor is, the process must be simple to understand for the primary users. So, let’s begin with the step-by-step guide on how to color match different video clips in PowerDirector.

The Color Match feature of CyberLink PowerDirector allows matching tones and colors on selected video clips.

## Part 1: How to Color Match Different Video Clips in PowerDirector?

Applying color match/color correction to different clips at the same time also speeds up your workflow.

**Step 1: Download ColorDirector**

The first step to effectively do color matching in CyberLink PowerDirector is to download the ColorDirector. It contains a real camera and color effects to achieve cinematic color match editing.

**Step 2: Apply Presets to multiple clips on singletrack**

We assume that you already have clips imported into the timeline. Thus, do a left-click on the first clip, select **Fix/Enhance** tab, and then choose **ColorDirector** in the preview window.

**Step 3: Make manual adjustments**

Yes, you are required to make manual adjustments by clicking the **Manual** and **Adjustments** tab in the preview window.

You can now make some adjustments to **RGB Channel**, as here we have made it a little darker.

After you’re over with the manual adjustment, click **Back** to go back to the PowerDirector. Now, you can see that an adjustment is made to the selected clip.

Then, you need to click **Apply to All** and see the effect getting added to all the clips on the same track.

**Step 4: Apply color match adjustments at different tracks**

Again, apply the same process by left-clicking the video clip on a different track. Select **Fix/Enhance** and then go to **Color Director**.

Now, make some adjustments to the **RBG Channel** as we have made it a little brighter here. Then, you need to save this adjustment as Preset to apply to multiple clips simultaneously on different tracks. Hit the **Create** \> **Preset** tab as shown in the image below.
