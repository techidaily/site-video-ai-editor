## MOV Won't Play Window Media Player Problems:

"I upload moves from my KODAK digital camera. The are 'transformed' into .MOV files. The won't play properly using WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER (windows 7). I.E. only the audio plays........no video plays. Do I need to download REALPLAYER?"

"I have Vista 64\. My camera takes 1080p video in .Mov format, so I have to install Apple Craptime (quicktime) to play the movies on my computer. I absolutely hate Quicktime and end up uninstalling it after watching the videos, then I have to re-install to watch them again. Annoying. I brought my flash drive with the movies on it to my friends house, she has Windows 7, which I installed on her older computer. The movies all show up as WMP files and play on WMP."

"Windows Media Player cannot play the file. The Player might not support the file type or might not support the codec that was used to compress the file."

## Why Mov File Won't Play in Windows Media Player?

Generally, there are mainly 3 reasons that lead to fail playback of a certain media file: 

**1\. Windows Media Player has no supports for codecs contained in MOV container**  
For instance, iOS iPhone/iPad shoots videos in .mov by default, in h264\. So if your WMP can't play the MOV file, chances are that it does not support H264 codec even it has the corresponding demuxer.

**2\. Low Computer Specs or Bad Sectors on Hard Disk**  
iPhone 6s and above iOS devices record MOV videos generally in 30fps in 4K, or 1080P 60fps through adjustment. If your computer monitor, or RAM, or CPU/GPU spec that is not on par with the supportable standard, then the problem may not lie in the media player. 

**3\. MOV File Damage**  
Corrupted broken MOV files usually cannot open in many media player software including Windows Media Player. Specific media players, i.e. 5KPlayer, VLC, can handle corrupted/broken MOV files or MOV files in the raw form, because they can skip certain part of the video and seek the unbroken parts to read.
