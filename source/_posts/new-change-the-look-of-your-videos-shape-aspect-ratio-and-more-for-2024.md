While most videos nowadays are rectangular, and are recorded in either landscape or portrait orientation, there are some social media platforms that require the clips to be square shaped. If you want to upload your footages on such websites, it is essential to learn **how to change video shape**.

Another benefit of changing the shape of the recorded films is that they can be adjusted in limited amount of space, especially if they are to be posted on a website. Furthermore, some fancy designs such as star-shaped or circle-shaped videos attract more attention when used in digital marketing campaigns.

With that said, here you will learn **how to change the shape of a video** using one of the most advanced and versatile post-production tools, Wondershare Filmora.

Or, you just want to [transfer your video into vertical.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## Part 1: How to Change Video Shape from Rectangle to Square

Depending on the recording device and the target audiences a video is intended to be distributed to, the aspect ratio of the produced footage could be 16:9, 4:3, or 21:9 that makes the film rectangular-shaped. Given that, the aspect ratio can be modified to change the film shape from rectangle to square.

The instructions given below explain **how to change video shape** from rectangle to square in Wondershare Filmora:

**Step 1: Import Video to Timeline**

Launch Wondershare Filmora on your PC (a Windows 10 computer is used here), click the **Add Files** icon from the center of the **Media** window present at the upper-left section, and use the **Open** box that appears to select and import the source video to Filmora. Next, drag the video from the **Media** window to the Timeline, and select your preferred option when/if the **Project Setting** confirmation box appears.

**Step 2: Change Aspect Ratio**

Select the video in the Timeline, and click the **Crop and Zoom** icon from the upper-left area of the Timeline itself. On the **Crop and Zoom** window that opens next, select **1:1** from the **Ratio** drop-down list, and click **OK** to save the new setting.

**Step 3: Export the Video**

Click **EXPORT** from the top-center area of the interface, go to the **Local** tab on the **Export** box, select your preferred format from the **Format** list in the left pane, optionally click **SETTINGS** from the right window to make other adjustments if necessary, and click **EXPORT** from the bottom-right corner of the box.

For more details, please refer to this article: [How to Resize a Video to Right Aspect Ratio and Size.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## Part 2: Change Video Shape by Cropping

If your preferred aspect ratio isn’t available in the ‘Ratio’ drop-down list of the ‘Crop and Zoom’ window, Wondershare Filmora allows you to manually change the video to a custom shape.

## Part 3: Change Video Shape to Circle or Other Shapes in Filmora

That said, following are the instructions to apply both types of masking to your videos:

#### Image Masking

You can double-click any of the available shape presets to apply it to the video layer. In addition, drag the **X** and **Y**, and **Width**, **Height**, and **Feather** sliders to adjust the mask’s position, size, and edge smoothness respectively.

Finally, click **OK** to save the changes, and follow the method explained in earlier parts to export the video.

If this is the case so it is not a good idea to make longer videos. This means that if your videos will be short and simple then they can easily get more audience and will also get shared widely. You should keep the first few moments of your video so engaging and interesting so that the viewer can stick back till the end. This is very important to leave a positive impact of your brand on your audience and targeted users.

The only thing to keep in mind is that they should be completely relevant to the topic and content.

**Simple and short -** In today’s world, as all the people are so busy in their works and daily schedules they can easily get distracted by the things. If this is the case so it is not a good idea to make longer videos. This means that if your videos will be short and simple then they can easily get more audience and will also get shared widely. You should keep the first few moments of your video so engaging and interesting so that the viewer can stick back till the end. This is very important to leave a positive impact of your brand on your audience and targeted users.

**Add the logo:** Twitter also suggests its users to add their logo in the frame of their videos. By logo, people can easily recognize your brand and they will also know about you via that logo. They will also be able to contact you further. The only worth considering thing is that the logo which you are adding must be engaging and eye-catching.

**Use the correct tools -** Using the correct tools cannot be neglected. If the tools that you are using will not be appropriate then they can lessen the quality of your videos.
