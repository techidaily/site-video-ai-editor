How to rotate videos? On the way of your family tour or honeymoon, it is often the case that you shoot your digital camera or iPhone 4K HDR video clips in portrait mode, but when you sit down and watch them on a computer or TV, they'll always be landscape mode. So, **how to rotate videos** in 4K to be the way you intended? And how to rotate the iPhone video without quality loss? Here we recommend you the powerful [**5KPlayer**](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/).

To rotate a video, 5KPlayer has its own principle –only rotate video display, which means that your videos will be rotated while playing yet the whole file will not be converted, **video not rotated permanently**. So, while shooting a video clip, if you unconsciously turned the shooting from portrait mode to landscape mode and then again back to portrait mode, 5KPlayer will make up for your "orientation" mistakes by rotating the video any time you want during playback. Besides, for those who are afraid of quality loss during video rotate, 5KPlayer can efficiently avoid that problem by temporarily changing the video display state.

**To permanently rotate a video from iPhone**, we recommend you WinX or MacX video converter. That software allows you to loop the video and save it as the rotated way. [Click to learn how to rotate iPhone videos free](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) with MacX video converter.
