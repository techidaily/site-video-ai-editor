When you ask how to **listen to Apple music without iTunes**, I guess you probably mean how to listen to Apple music on computer without iTunes since any iOS device with the latest Apple Music app would allow you to play Apple music on PC, assuming you have Apple ID and WiFi connection. Since Apple has no obvious intention to distribute a standalone Apple Music web player like Spotify or Amazon Music for Mac/PC users, and common media players like VLC totally can't play downloaded Apple music as .m4p with DRM, iTunes seems to be the only way to play Apple music on computer. However, there is always a way out to listen to Apple music without iTunes.

As designer and developer Andrew Ambrosino said, "For Apple Music to win, iTunes as we know it must die." iTunes is working seamlessly with Apple Music on computer indeed for whatever purpose that a standalone music app for listening to Apple music without iTunes must be a pipe dream. In all honesty, commercial interests go beyond music sharing because everytime iTunes won't load Apple Music or just gets a blank screen, it will redirect you to the Store section where music purchase is available.
