## Best Online Video Collage Makers \[Free & Paid\]

Platforms that exclusively offer **video collage-making** services are rare, and in most cases, you have to use a [web-based video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) if you want to create video collages online.

In addition, the video editing platforms that do provide the video collage feature, offer only a limited amount of video editing tools, which is the reason why it is still better to use [video editing software for PC](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or Mac computers if you want to make video collages professionally. However, there are still a few online destinations where you can combine several videos with ease.

#### 1. [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/collage)
