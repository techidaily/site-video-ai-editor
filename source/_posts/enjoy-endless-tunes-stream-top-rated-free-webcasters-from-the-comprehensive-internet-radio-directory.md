## Listen to Internet Radio Stations Free

If you want to listen to internet radio stations free, you've come to the right place! Best online radio stations are assorted for you to enjoy online internet radios of all categories –music, stories, business, news etc.

#### **Why Do We Choose Internet Radio Stations?**

In Comparison with Satellite Radio, internet radio stations offer much more advantages: 

● **Cost-free or of little cost;**

Some radio stations like Pandora, Spotify will charge you at a low price on a monthly basis, while others like BBC, iHeart, Kisstory won't cost you a dime. 

● **Stable reception and easy access;**

Simply with a radio player, a computer, a network connection and a speaker, you can play tons of online radios within a few licks wherever you are regardless of the factors for traditional radio reception. Also, you can quickly get access to the sports game or music you prefer rather than tuning to the right radio station you like which can take a while or longer. 

● **More varied choices: genres from around the world;**

Internet radio stations eliminate all boundaries. You can find talk shows, sports, news, music, economy etc across the globe for more exotic enjoyment rather than clinging to local radio stations with same old styles. 

#### **Is Internet Radio Facing A Big Threat from Those Wireless Providers?**

Verizon hiked the fee for those grandfathered unlimited data plan users from $29.99 to $49.99 per month in a presumable attempt to coax those granted customers off that tasty cake. It seems that this move may exert pressure on internet based radio stations as most of their clients are mobile users. 

However, compared with T-Mobile's unlimited plan of $80 per month, this subtle increase of fee looks just somewhat reasonable for better quality, and even if it has influences on internet radio station subscribers, the range is relatively small –less 1% of costumers . People can turn to satellite radio stations, traditional FM radio stations, or better still, make use of Wi-Fi network or turn off their cellular to prevent overuse of data while listening to online radio stations.
