## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** Found a video on Instagram with audio that you really like? Well, then it's easy enough to get your hand on it (so long as you don't intend to make use of it nefariously, of course!)

**●** There are Instagram-to-MP3 converters that will allow you to literally convert your favorite Instagram videos into an MP3 in a single click (without having to ever even download or install anything!)

**●** Although, of course, if you're looking for something more advanced than you're average, online video converter tool, there are other more premium options that you can try out to step up your game.
