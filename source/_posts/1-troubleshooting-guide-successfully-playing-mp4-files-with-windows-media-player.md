## How to Play MP4 Files on Windows/Mac \[Solved\]

 _Posted by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last update: April 28, 2020_

Can Windows Media Player play MP4? Windows media player natively does not support MP4 files until it upgrades to version 12\. So, for those dedicated users who are using Windows Media Player 11 and lower, you’d better upgrade the Media Player for MP4 playback.

## How to Play MP4 on Windows Media Player 12?

Still cannot play MP4 files on Windows Media Player 12? Remember, MP4 is a contain format that may contain many codecs which cannot be played by your Windows Media Player 12\. Therefore, you should first know about what are the codecs of your MP4 files supported by Windows Media Player 12.

**Tell Which Windows Media Player MP4 Codecs are Installed on the Computer**

Do the following to see the [MP4 codecs](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) supported by your Windows Media Player:

1\. Find the _Help_ menu on the menu bar, and click "About Windows Media Player".  
If you cannot find the Help, click Organize and navigate to Layout, and then select Show menu bar.

2\. On the About Windows Media Player dialog box, click _Technical Support Information_.  
Then your default web browser will open a page that includes information about the supported video audio codecs, plug-ins and other things installed on your computer.

It is obvious that **Windows Media Player 12 supports MP4** video and audio files, including .m4a, .mp4, .m4v, .mp4v, .3g2, .3gp2, .3gp, .3gpp, but codecs like HEVC H.263/H.264/H.265, MPEG-4 ASP, H.264/MPEG-4 AVC,H.263, VC-1, Dirac, MPEG-2/4 (HE)-AAC, AC-3, Apple Lossless, ALS, SLS, Vorbis(with private objectTypeIndication) may not be supported by your Windows Media Player. Therefore, if you are holding a MP4 file encoded in H.264, your Windows Media Player 12 cannot help you out. 

Windows Media Player upgrade can only help you get partial MP4 files open successfully. If WMP upgrade cannot solve MP4 playback issue, you may have to consider other approaches. 

**I. Windows Media Player MP4 Codec Pack Download**

Windows Media Player MP4 codec pack can be downloaded from its official website as well as online sites: Softonic and CNET fast and easily. However, in case of MP4 codec incompatibility that may cause the instability of WMP functions, we suggest the following more stable and easy ways to play MP4 instead of Windows Media Player. 

**II. Windows MP4 Converter.** 

Why not convert the MP4 into Windows media player supported format like WMV, AVI? [WinX HD Video Converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/) is recommended here for quality and speedy conversion.
