#### **Further Reading about XviD & DivX:**

The name XviD, as you may probably know, is just DivX written backwards. This may tell all that XviD is the primary competitor of DivX. DivX is a known video codec that is used in most video and audio recording and it isn't free whereas XviD on the other hand is free and open source. XviD is generally better as known to all and they are both developing vigorously. However XviD requires a more compatible XviD player like 5KPlayer and the Xvid Player will play DivX with no problem as well.
