**★ Media Player Classic Crashing on Windows 10? \[Solved\]** 

_**Q:** "1.7.8 64 bit crashes with dump on w10 build 9926 opening any file. mpc-hc 1.7.8 32bit also crashes on file open. mpc 32/64 works ok if just opened and using interface. crash occurs only when opening file."_  
**A:** This is also the same as v1.7.7/1.7.9\. Obviously, after you have updated to 1.7.8 or 1.7.9, the MPC crashing problem still exist. About the crash, it's probably be caused by the ATI video driver that is not very stable on Windows 10\. You might want to (re)install the latest version or even try downgrading it. If it doesn't work, you can try turning off the DXVA acceleration just in case (Options > Internal filters > Video decoder, set "HW acceleration" to "None"). 

_**Q:** "I am using windows 10 with all updates (1511; 10586.122), nvidia 361.91 (although there is 362.00\. I'm testing right away). LAV filters I'm using from K-lite mega codec pack 12 (64-bit media player classic, lots of stuff (Updated MPC-HC to version 1.7.10.101; Updated LAV Filters to version 0.67-142-gb9999)) with svp 64-bit reinstalled above it."_  
**A:** You may have updated your [Media Player Classis for Windows 10](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) to the newest version 1.7.10 and let all other features upgrade, but MPC crashes on Windows 10 as usual. You can turn off the DXVA acceleration as Q1 listed above to see if it works. If the answer is no, the Windows 10 experience issues are with SVP. The most frequent one is because of the latest NVIDIA video drivers. The first thing you sholud do to the crashes of MPC-HC is to switch hardware decoder in LAV Video Decoder from "NVIDIA CUVID" to "DXVA2 (copy-back)" and then disable the GPU acceleration. 

_**Q:** "mpc-hc crashes out and i get a crash log informing me that it's ffdshow that has crashed. i have the video and audio filters blocked in mpc-hc, and the raw video preferred - since without it, you can't use svp. if i try to play a video with svp enabled, mpc-hc consistently crashes i'm unable to until i disable svp."_  
**A:** You can try to disable GPU-acceleration in SVP or to disable CUVID in LAV decoder to see if it has any effect. More easily, you can get help from Media Player Classic alternative - 5KPlayer to solve the problem once for all. 

_**Q:** "In my experiencde, MPC starts crashing everytime I've installed an update of the K Lite Codec Pack. I get the impression there's some fault in the update or install procedure of that codec pack (which MPC is bundled with)."_  
**A:** Chances are you are using a 3rd party program to help with the video card management, like EVGA Precision. Uninstall the said program ->restart your computer and try watching a video again.

**★ Media Player Classic Crashes on Startup? \[Solved\]** 

_**Q:** "Crashes on starup, worked fine until a couple of days ago. No major system changes. Definitely not caused by antivirus software or firewall as those two have always been running and never interfered with the program before."_

**A:** This kind of problem often happens on MPC v1.7.7 on Win7 X64/32 bit and Win10 as well. After you have uninstall the unofficial version and install the latest official build, the problem still persists. How to solve it? Besides updating to v1.7.10, you can check if you use Comodo or AVG by any chance that will prevent you from opening the program. In avg's advanced settings, add mpc to exceptions -> check off Resident shield, Manual and scheduled scan and identity protection-> hit ok and should allow mpc to work as intended. 

**★ MPC Crashes Playing MKV/MP4/AV/MOV/Midi etc.? \[Solved\]** 

_**Q:** "Could someone help me make MPC-HC working? It cannot play a thing, does not matter what format mp4, mkv, wmv, mov, avi all of them crashes MPC-HC, giving me opportunity to write down some comments for crashing."_

**A:** 1\. Can't play MKV/MP4/AVI etc with MPC? You can try to change the video output settings: Go to View->Options/Playback/Output->DirectShow Video and choose the proper output (System Default, Overlay mixer Renderer, Enhanced Video Renderer etc.).  
2\. Sometimes you will find the Lav Splitter, Lav Video decoder and Lav Audio decoder are in the same samples as other players, but they play MKV/MP4/AVI smoothly while your MPC crashes. Under the circumstance, you'd better try [Media Player Classic Alternatives](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) more conveniently. 

**★ Media Player Classic Crashes Playing DVD? \[Solved\]**

_**Q:** Media Player Classic freezes when trying to play a DVD._ 

**A:** Make sure that your DVD drive is set at the correct region, and that the region of your DVD drive matches that of the DVD. You can edit the region settings of your DVD drive here: Start -> Settings -> Control Panel -> System -> Hardware -> Device Manager -> DVD/CD-ROM drives. Some old versions of Media Player Classic couldn't play some region DVDs, so you have to update it to the latest version for DVD playback. Or try other [region-free DVD player ->>](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/).

It is obviously quiet complicated and time-consuming to find the settings one by one and follow the steps to fix all Media Player Classic crashing problems. Besides, these tips may not be useful for your issues, and you have to spend some time to login MPC-HC Bug Tracker (https://trac.mpc-hc.org/wiki/How\_to\_Report\_Issues) to submit your tickect or send email to MPC-HC Crash Reporter (https://mpc-hc.org/crash-reporter/) when the Crash Reporter window appears.
