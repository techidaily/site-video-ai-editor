## Top Best 5 Free MPEG Video Joiners

# Top Best 5 Free MPEG Video Joiners

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

##### Ollie Mattison

 Mar 27, 2024â€¢ Proven solutions

 Video joining is an important aspect of video editing. There is a number of software that you can use to achieve the manipulation of your files in this way. Below are five of the most popular MPEG Video joiners.

* [Movica](#tab%5F01)
* [MediaJoin](#tab%5F02)
* [HJSplit](#tab%5F03)
* [Video Toolbox](#tab%5F04)
* [Format Factory](#tab%5F05)
* [Recommended: Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor)](#tab%5F06)

## [#1\. Movica](http://sourceforge.net/projects/movica/)

 This is a video joining freeware that also acts as a GUI of other tools like flvtool and MpgTx which handle the video editing work of the software. The software enables you to split files such as those with WMV, RM, MPG and FLV formats and then join them back together. It provides lots of keyboard shortcuts.

![free mpeg joiner](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/movica.jpg "free mpeg joiner")

**Pros:**

* Keyboard shortcuts;
* Provides fast operations depending on file sizes;
* Enables you to save parts of a video split to be edited.

**Cons:**

* Some status messages can be hard to understand;
* May come with the requirement for your system to have Windows Media Player.

## [#2\. MediaJoin](https://download.cnet.com/MediaJoin/3000-2141%5F4-55939.html)

 This free joining software supports such formats as MPEG-1, MPEG2, WMV, MP3, AVI, OGG, WAV and WMA. Joining the files is as easy as selecting them in a sequence and selecting the type of media as well as output format. All you then need to do is to specify compression codecs or video profiles depending on your needs.

![free mpeg joiner](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/mediajoin.jpg "free mpeg joiner")

**Pros:**

* Provides a solution for joining audio and video files;
* Has an easy user interface.

**Cons:**
