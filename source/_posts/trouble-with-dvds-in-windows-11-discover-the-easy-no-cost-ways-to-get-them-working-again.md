I deleted the app, then paid $14.99 to re-install the app. The same thing occurred when I tried to play a dvd. I am running windows 10 32 bit._"  
"_Just how could MS a program (player) that is this bad. The first DVD player I have from 20 years ago had better controls than this app. MS should maybe feel bad about the program of sell it for $2 to match it unrefined performance._"  
"_Sucked, freezing up all the time_"
