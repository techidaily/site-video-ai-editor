The Glitch Art movement is gaining a lot of attention on social media, as the photos and videos that contain glitches gather thousands of views and likes. Some video editing software products don’t have preset glitch effects, and creating this effect from scratch can be a time-consuming task.

Online glitch effect generators enable you to add glitch effects to both photos and videos even if you have no previous video editing experience, which makes them a great option for all social media content creators who want to go through the editing process as quickly as possible. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through some of the best free online glitch effect generators you can use to edit photos and videos.

## The Best Free Online Glitch Effect Generators

With so many online glitch effect generators to choose from, finding the one that fits all your needs may be difficult. We’ve selected some of the best online glitch effect generators you can use for free to create content for your social media channels. Let’s take a look at what they have to offer

### 1. GFTO

GFTO is an online text generator that offers hundreds of text templates, including the Glitch Text template. Customizing this template is easy as you just have to replace the generic text and adjust its on-screen position. Furthermore, you can choose the text’s color and size or select one of the available fonts.

![Glitch text effect generator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/engfto-generator_glitch_logo_font_text_effect.jpg)

The platform also lets you upload your own fonts, apply gradients, and change the text style. Optionally, you can add an outline to the text, pick the color of the text edges, or change the background. Once you are done editing the text you can save it to your computer as a PNG file and use it as an opening title for your video.

**Pros**

* Rich font selection
* Powerful text editing tools
* Allows users to upload their fonts
* Offers a broad range of text templates

**Cons**

* Outdated website design
* No photo or video editing features

### 2. EPHOTO 360

If you are looking for a tool that allows you to automatically generate the content you can share on TikTok, then you should consider using EPHOTO 360\. You can use this glitch effect generator for free and you don’t even need an account in order to start making new content. Simply locate the Tik Tok Text Effects Online Generator option that is located in the Text Effect category and click on it.

![ephoto360 Glitch text effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ephoto360-text-effects-online-generator.jpg)

Once the new page loads, you just have to insert the text into the text boxes and click on the GO button. EPHOTO 360 will then generate the image containing the text you entered. You can then choose if you want to save the picture to your computer, share it on social media, or copy the image’s link. However, all photos you create with EPHOTO 360 are going to be watermarked.

**Pros**

* A simple way of producing content for TikTok
* All images are exported as JPEG files
* Features hundreds of text templates
* Good file-sharing capabilities

**Cons**

* All images are generated automatically
* EPHOTO 360 watermarks all pictures

### 3. Photo Mosh

Photo Mosh grants you access to 27 different glitch effects you can apply to photos or short videos. The platform lets you choose if you want to create a JPEG, GIF, or WEBM file, although the videos you record with Photo Mosh cannot last more than a few seconds.

![Photo Mosh](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/photomosh-glitch-effect-video.jpg)

Applying the effects is easy, as you just have to expand the effect you want to use, click on the ON checkbox, and adjust the effect’s settings. All changes you make are visible in the preview screen so that you can see the results. In case you want to apply random effects to an image or video you uploaded, you just have to click on the Mosh button. All photos or short videos you create with this platform can be saved on your computer’s hard drive.

**Pros**

* Offers a variety of glitch effects
* Easy way to edit photos and short videos
* Mosh button enables the platform’s users to create random results
* Allow users to save videos in WEBM file format

**Cons**

* No file-sharing capabilities
* Creates low-resolution files

### 4. Glitchatron

Adding a glitch to a photo with Glitchatron is a straightforward task that can be completed in just a few moments. Once you’ve uploaded the photo to which you want to apply a glitch effect, you should choose from Low, Medium, High, Extreme, and Destroyed glitch level options.

![Glitchatron](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/errozero-glitch-effect-generator.jpg)

Glitchatron also lets you apply a circular or triangular mask to the photo or add a text overlay. You can insert the text, adjust its size, pick an alignment option, or decide if you want the text to be black or white. However, other color options are unavailable, and you can’t change the font. You can save the photo in PNG file format to your computer or share it on Facebook, Twitter, and other popular social media networks.

**Pros**

* No photo editing skills required
* Users can adjust the intensity of the glitch effect
* Text overlays are available
* Good social sharing capabilities

**Cons**

* Text can be either black or white
* No photo editing tools

### 5. ImageGlitcher

You shouldn’t expect great results from this online glitch generator, as the website is poorly designed and it offers only a few basic glitch adjustment options. The size of the photo you upload to the website has an impact on how it is going to be displayed, which means that photos in large resolutions may be difficult to preview.

![ImageGlitcher](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/airtightinteractive-image-glitcher.jpg)

Furthermore, you can only adjust Glitchiness and Brightness options, while you can also toggle the Scan Line option on and off. You can’t do much else with ImageGlitcher, not even share your creations on social media. Applying the glitch effect to a photo may take a while, and the website might crash in the process. That’s why you shouldn’t use ImageGlitcher unless it is your only option to glitch a photo.

**Pros**

* It is free
* Support images saved in JPEG format

**Cons**

* Website crashes easily
* Only basic glitch effect settings
* Poorly designed and difficult to navigate
* Only works with photos that have resolution lower than 1024x1024

### 6. Image Glitch Tool

Image Glitch Tool is a simple glitch effect generator that allows you to upload a photo and adjust the effect’s settings quickly. The photo you upload to this platform is going to be displayed in the Preview Window, and the platform will also resize the photo automatically in case it exceeds its size limitations to avoid errors.

![Image Glitch Tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jpg-glitch.jpg)

What’s more, Image Glitch Tool enables you to take photos with a webcam and apply glitch effect to them just moments after you captured them. The Amount, Seed, Iterations, and Quality sliders allow you to fine-tune the glitch effect so that it fits the image you are editing. However, creating a text overlay with this online glitch generator is not possible as you can only use it to apply the glitch effect to photos.

**Pros**

* Intuitive and functional design
* Allows users to take photos with a webcam
* Photos are adjusted automatically to the platform’s size requirements
* All photos can be uploaded to Imgur directly from Image Glitch Tool

**Cons**

* Doesn’t support video files
* Offers just one glitch effect

### 7. Mara

Mara is an online photo editing platform that lets its users crop photos, create image overlays, sharpen images, and much more. Its Glitcher feature provides an easy way to apply a glitch effect to a photo. You can upload a photo from your computer, via an URL or from Dropbox.

![Mara Glitcher](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mara-photos-glitcher.jpg)

The photo will open in the Glitcher window as soon as you upload it, so you can use the Seed, Amount, Iterations, and Quality sliders to create a glitch effect. In addition, you can transfer the photo you’re editing with the Glitcher tool to other tools Mara photo editing platform offers and use them to polish the photo to which you applied the glitch effect. Besides saving the photo to your computer, you can also share it to Facebook and other social media platforms.

**Pros**

* Powerful glitch tool

* Mara is equipped with a broad range of photo editing tools
* Excellent social sharing options

### 8. HTML5 Image Glitcher

Before you upload a photo, you should decide if you want to keep the file’s actual size or resize it to a lower resolution. Also, this tool lets you choose if you want to create a JPEG, PNG, or WEBP file.

![HTML5 Image Glitcher](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/html5-image-glitcher.jpg)

Once you’ve adjusted these settings you can proceed to select how damaged the photo is going to be, and you should pick the 1-hit option if you want the damage to be minimal or 1000-hits option if you want the damage to be severe. The results will be displayed in the Preview Window immediately so that you can adjust this setting accordingly. You can save the photo you created by either clicking on Download JPEG or Download PNG file.

**Pros**
