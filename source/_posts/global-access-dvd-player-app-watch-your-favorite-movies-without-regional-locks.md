 _Posted by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last update: April 28, 2020_

Thinking about that the James Bond Film Series Spectre DVD finally come out but you can't watch it at home (James Bond Films deserve your collection and frequent appreciation, of course), how disgusting it is!

#### **Why Region Free DVD Player Software is Needed?**

I'll start with a bad news. Most commercial DVDs adopt encryption technology to protect its copy right, one of which is "region code", meaning that DVDs play only on DVD players with the same region code.

That's why region free DVD player is favored by DVD collectors and frequent travelers. Here's a good news: you can download region free DVD player software, [5KPlayer](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/) now, a feature-rich free DVD player software.
