### Part 1\. About DVD and DVD Related Video Formats

Digital Video Disc (DVD) refers to a format, designed for digital optical disc storage, developed by the joint effort of Philips, Sony, Toshiba, and Panasonic in 1995, can be played by free DVD player software. 18 generations including DVD-1 to DVD-18 ranging from DVD-R/RW, DVD+R/RW (plus), DVD-RAM, and read-only formats BD-ROM, DVD ROM, DVD-D, DVD Plus have come into being. Generally a complete DVD file consists video\_ts and audio\_ts, otherwise a DVD file can hardly be read by any of your DVD player software on computers. 

The most advanced Blu-ray DVD and HD DVD provide amazing storage spaces up to 50GB and 30GB, and DVD DS DL can store up to 15.9GB, proving DVD actually one of the most ideal storage medium that cannot be easily replaced by digital cloud drive or hard-drive entirely. To that end, a professional DVD player software is a must-have in the coming couple of decades for Windows (10) or Mac computer.
