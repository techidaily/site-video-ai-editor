## What is 4K Resolution?

4K resolution refers to a display device or content having horizontal resolution on the order of 4,000 pixels. 4K resolution provides more pixels than the ordinary HD 1080p images, thus, giving more nuance and details.

Let's do this math:   
 4K: 4096(horizontal) X 2160(vertical) =8,847,360 pixels  
 HD: 1920(horizontal) X 1080(vertical) =2,073,400 pixels  
 The pixel of 4K resolution is over 4 times that of the HD 1080p, the clearer, the better!

And if that is too abstract for you, watch this:

Which image will your eyes pick as the better one to enjoy? Absolutely the latter one!  
 So, that is what 4K resolution is all about –more exquisite and fine images.

When we become shortsighted, we chronically tend to buy a pair of glasses or even have myopic operations. Why? The inner demand that makes us unwilling to miss a bit!
