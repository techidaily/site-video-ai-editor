A file with .ogg extension generally contains audio. By now Xiph.Org maintains the Ogg multimedia containers and several types of Ogg audio formats like Vorbis, Theora and Speex.

Compared to MP3, Ogg can be realized under relatively low data rate which is better than MP3\. Although there isn't much difference in sound quality between Ogg vorbis audio files and MP3 format files, Ogg can still adjust to clear sound quality and a new algorithm for training after the file format is fixed, because Ogg utilizes a rather flexible format.
