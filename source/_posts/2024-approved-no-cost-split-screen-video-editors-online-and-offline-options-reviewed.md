**Step 4: Enable Split Screen**

Click **VFX** from above the preview window, click the **+** (**Add new effects</b >) icon from the top of the left pane, select the DVE category from the upper-right corner of the left pane, scroll down the left pane to the Split-screen Presets section, and double-click your preferred split screen preset to add the effect to the participating clips.**

**Pros**

* Even the free variant has split screen feature
* A complete post-production tool that doesn’t require any other program for finalizing the things

### 6. Adobe Premiere Pro

One of the most appreciated and widely used post-production applications for Windows and Mac computers, Adobe Premiere Pro has been professionals’ first choice when it comes to video editing, irrespective of the fact that it has a steep learning curve, and is also a resource intensive software to work with.

The steps below explain how to use Adobe Premiere Pro as a **split screen video maker**:

**Step 1: Add Videos to Timeline**

After importing the clips to the **Project** window, drag each of them to the Timeline, and place them in their separate tracks one above the other.

**Step 3: Crop the Clips**

Search for the **Crop** effect in the **Effects** pane present at the lower-left corner, drag and drop the effect on each of the clips in the timeline, and use the **Crop** slider in the **Effect Controls** pane to crop the videos as needed. Optionally use the keyframes to add sliding animations to give more professional look to the split screen effect.

**Step 1: Place Footages in the Timeline**

As mentioned earlier, add the clips on top of each other on separate tracks in the Timeline of FCPX.

### FAQs About Split Screen Video Editors

#### Why you should use split screen effect in video?

There are a couple of reasons you may want to use split screen effect in your video. Some of the most common uses include:

* Showing multiple actions by the same or different characters at the same time, without changing the screen
* Comparing multiple objects or picture quality. This can be done only when the entities in question are placed side-by-side
* Making your video look more professional
* Showing different effects on the same screen

#### Can I create a split screen video with Windows Movie Maker or Windows 10 Photos app?

No, you cannot. Although these tools enable you to resize the videos, since they don’t allow multi-tracked Timelines, no video clips can be placed one above the other which is an essential part for any **split screen video maker** to create the effect. However, as discussed above, there are several post-production tools, offline and online, that allow you to make split screen videos easily and without any cost.

**Conclusion**

[**Split screen video editor**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) tools are both paid and free. Regardless of the program you use to create the effect, the output files always look more professional and informative. Furthermore, things become way simpler if the **split screen video maker** has simple UI, is less resource intensive, and is easy to use as it is the case with Wondershare Filmora.
