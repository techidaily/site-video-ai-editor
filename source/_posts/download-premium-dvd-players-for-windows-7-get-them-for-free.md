## Best DVD Player Software Windows 7 Free Download

 _Posted by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last update: April 28, 2020_

Just like many other committed users of Windows 7, you might also encounter the very common problem that the default Windows 7 media player can't play DVD videos/movies. Generally, such annoying problem can't be fixed even though you've tried all sorts of approaches. But today is your luck day! The **best free DVD player software for Windows 7** is ready to help you get over all DVD playback difficulties on Windows 7,8,10.

#### **Let's First Check Some Common "DVD Won't Play" Problems on Windows 7**

As the default DVD player software for Windows 7, Windows Media Player (WMP) is always imperfect when it comes to DVD playback. According to comprehensive feedback from various forums and Microsoft official website, we compiled the following DVD playback problems which are commonly met by Win 7 WMP users:  
 \* DVD codec missing   
 \* Copy protection issue  
 \* Impropriate region code  
 \* WMP Freezes and Restarts  
 \* WMP Black Screen

#### **Commonly-used Solutions and Their Risks:**

It's often the case that you are suggested to download the necessary codec from the web for free or for a fee, so as to save your default free DVD player software for Windows 7\. Failing to fix problems aside, this method can cause other serious playback issues in WMP, lead to system corruption, and even make it difficult for Microsoft to diagnose and troubleshoot playback issues. For these reasons, we strongly discourage you from installing the codec packs but choose a professional Windows 7 DVD player software.

If you encounter an error message that indicates you are playing a DVD with wrong region code, you should manually change the current DVD region setting of your Window 7 DVD player software, which is a complicated process. But even worse, if you find your WMP freezing, restarting, or showing nothing (black screen) when playing a DVD on Windows 7, no one can help you because there is no exact reason for these troubles. Maybe you can try downgrading WMP-the built-in DVD player software on Windows 7 to a lower version, but get yourself psyched up for suffering more bugs.

**Important**: The region settings can be changed only a limited number of times. When you select a new region, an alert will be displayed warning you that after this, you will only be able to play DVDs on Windows 7 from that region. Be aware that you might not be able to change the region setting for some DVD hardware and software decoders.

#### **The Best Free DVD Player Software for Windows 7 You Can Rely on!**

Not that you have find that WMP have a wide variety of problems playing DVD on Windows 7, just switch your mind to 5KPlayer-an omnipotent [free DVD player for Windows 10](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/)/7/8 and Mac OS to play any DVD on computer without the limitation of DVD region codes, codecs, and decoder.
