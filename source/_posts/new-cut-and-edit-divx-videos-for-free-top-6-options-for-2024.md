The staggering amounts of video content on the Internet are making it difficult to attract the attention of the audience you are targeting. Summarizing the highlights of your video in a short twenty to thirty-second trailer is one of the techniques you can use to spark the audience’s attention and ultimately increase the number of views your videos are getting.

Besides the promotional purposes, you can also use trailers to create entertaining short videos in order to have fun with your friends. Fortunately, you don’t need a [professional video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) suite to perform this task since there are hundreds of [video editing apps](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that allow you **to create trailers on iPhones and iPads.**

So, in this article we are going to take you through the top ten movie trailer apps for iPhones and iPads you can use to create eye-catching trailers for all types of videos you create.

## Top 10 Movie Trailer Apps for iPhones and iPads

Selecting the footage you are going to include in the trailer you are making, is probably the most difficult part of the process, since most movie trailer apps for iPhones and iPads offer customizable templates. In addition, the music you choose as the soundtrack for your trailer needs to match with the visuals and the editing style you opted for. Let’s take a look at the top 10 movie trailer apps for iPhones and iPads.

### 1\. [iMovie](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imovie/id377298193)

**Price:** Free

All iPhones and iPads offer a free way to edit all videos you record with them. All you need to do is make sure that iMovie is installed on your iPhone or iPad and you can start editing the footage you recorded. In addition, you can also import videos recorded with different types of cameras into iMovie, as long as they are saved in the file format that is compatible with this app.

iMovie offers a variety of predesigned trailer themes, so you just have to pick the one you like the most and then choose the footage you want to include in your trailer. Keep in mind that you cannot add music to any of the trailer themes, but you can export the trailer you created and create the soundtrack from iMovie’s Video mode. What’s more, you can also use this app to [add transitions](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), visual effects or [titles](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to the trailers you create with iMovie.

### 2\. [Intro.Maker +3D Movie Trailer](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/intro-maker-3d-movie-trailer/id1204817203)

**Price:** Free, offers in-app purchases

![ Intro.Maker +3D Movie Trailer ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/intro-maker-3d-movie-trailer.jpg)

You don’t have to be a seasoned filmmaker to create professionally looking trailers with Intro.Maker + 3D Movie Trailer. The app lets you choose from hundreds of HD templates that can be customized quickly to meet the demands of your project. Moreover, you can create your own templates and use them on all future projects. Videos that are saved on the device’s camera roll can be easily imported into the app, which means that you can start making a new trailer just moments after recording the footage.

The trailers you create with the free version of Intro.Maker + 3D Movie Trailer are going to be watermarked and you must make an in-app purchase in order to [remove the watermark](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Furthermore, features like Voice Record, Transitions or Fonts are not available on the free version of the app, which is the reason why it is advisable to purchase a monthly or the annual subscription if you are planning to create trailers with this app on a constant basis.

### 3\. [Intro Designer Lite – Create Intros for iMovie](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/intro-designer-lite-create-intros-for-imovie/id488748114)

**Price:** Free

![Intro Designer Lite &  Create Intros for iMovie ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/intro-designer-lite-create-intros-for-imovie.jpg)

The fact that Intro Designer Lite has more than five million downloads says a lot about its popularity. This iOS-based app is equipped with just six built-in templates, but you can download two more for free. Creating new trailers, openers or end credits requires you to go through three easy steps since you only have to select the template, add the footage and export the video.

Additionally, you can use this app to snap photos that you can use in the final cut of your trailer. Intro Designer Lite allows you to move and rotate all pictures you take with it so that they fit the trailer perfectly. This movie trailer app for iPhone and iPad devices is equipped with a plethora of text tools, which enables you to resize, move or even [animate all text](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you add to the trailer you are working on. The best part is that you can save all your projects, and continue working on them whenever you want.

### 4\. [Intro Maker – YT Intro Designer](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/intro-maker-yt-intro-designer/id1190034759)

**Price:** Free, offers in-app purchases

![ Intro Maker- yt intro designer Movie Trailer ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/intro-maker-yt-intro-designer.jpg)

If you are looking for an app that lets you [create intros for your YouTube videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) effortlessly, then Intro Maker is the right choice for you. There are more than a thousand available templates, while new templates are added on a weekly basis, which means that you are never going to run out of ideas for your next intro.

Besides the rich selection of templates the Intro Maker grants you access to hundreds of fonts, and effects stickers you can add to your projects with a single tap. Creating the soundtrack for the intro you’re working on is easy since there are more than 200 songs and sound effects to choose from. The number of projects you can create is not limited and each of them can be saved, which allows you to just modify an existing intro or a trailer and use it for a different purpose. However, you must upgrade to the VIP version of the app if you want to use all of its features.

### 5\. [Intro Maker: Vlog Video Maker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/intro-maker-vlog-video-maker/id1358216337)

**Price:** Free, offers in-app purchases

![ Intro Maker: Vlog Video Maker   ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/intro-maker-vlog-video-maker.jpg)

Making a trailer or an intro for the videos you share online shouldn’t take too much of your time. This iPhone app offers an easy solution to all vloggers and video content creators who want to create trailers for their film projects from their phones. There are more than a thousand customizable templates to choose from, as well as over 700 motion stickers. In addition, the app doesn’t limit the number of titles you can add to a single project, and it lets you adjust the size, shadow and stroke values for each title you include in a video.

Even though the app doesn’t have a library of [royalty-free songs](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can still use it to create soundtracks or even record voiceovers for your trailers. Moreover, the app’s file-sharing capabilities are underwhelming since you can only export videos to the camera roll. Purchasing the Intro Maker Premium or Premium Life Time subscription plans can be a good idea if you want to create new trailers and intros frequently.

### 6\. [IntroMate: Video Intro Maker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/intromate-video-intro-maker/id659353189)

When a product is branded with Adobe, it means high quality, better performance, and consistency with another program by Adobe. [Adobe Premiere Elements](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-elements.html) is a **good Vegas alternative for Windows** (Mac version also available). Just as what's said on its homepage "the #1 consumer video editing software", Adobe is a popular video editor for home users.

![sony vegas alternative adobe premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-premiere-elements-2021-interface.png)

For professionals, Adobe Premiere Pro is the better Sony Vegas alternative for Windows. It's the higher version of Premiere Element with differences in capturing, timeline editing, multiple sequence editing, DVD menu, surround sound mixing, etc.

#### 2\. ZS4 Video Editor - Free Alternative to Sony Vegas in Windows

[ZS4 Video Editor](http://www.zs4.net/news) is a free Sony Vegas alternative for Windows, Mac and Linux. It is the new incarnation of the free Zwei-Stein Video Editor. It comes with simple video editing tools and 150 video effects, but the interface is not so user-friendly. Compared to Wondershare [Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and [Adobe Premiere](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-elements.html), ZS4 Video Editor is not the common video editing software, but free is the most important factor for this Sony Vegas alternative.
