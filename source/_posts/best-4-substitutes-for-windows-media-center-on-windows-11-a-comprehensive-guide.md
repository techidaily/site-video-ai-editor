 _Posted by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last update: April 28, 2020_

Bear no delusion, Windows Media Center's death in Windows 10 is pinned to earth, meaning that among the arrays of new features Windows 10 possesses like revival of Start menu and employing virtual desktops, there'll be no room for Windows 10 Media Center, except alternatives! This has put HTPC and WMC pursuers into a dilemmaâ€“upgrading Windows 10 for advanced Windows experience and no more WMC, or not, forgoing the upgrade and sticking to your old Windows 7/8.1 OS with Media Center Pack add-on? But is there actually a way to have them both? **Windows Media Center Alternatives for Windows 10** listed here will well address the whole annoys for you!

Many **Windows Media Center alternatives** cannot work as good as WMC does - able to record TV (including encrypted, copy protected content with a cable card tuner), and pause, rewind and fast forward LIVE TV; you can also throw a couple terabyte HDDs inside, and use WMC to copy over your movie archive. However, cord-cutting movement with people ditching cable subscriptions has pushed the notion of this HTPC into a dark corner. Due to decreased WMC usage, described as "infinitesimal", it's hard to fault Microsoft's economical decision on killing Windows Media Center for Windows 10, while alternatives are surging to fill the hole. We still have all the ways to vote for Windows Media Center alternatives Windows 10 for HTPC experience:

Searching for the best Windows Media Center alternatives for Windows 10 that function exactly as Windows Media Center can be very hard. So here come the solutions:

You can balk at upgrading to Windows 10 and Windows 10 Media Center alternatives. Stick with Windows 7 or 8/8.1 Pro with Media Center Pack add-on supported until the year 2021 and 2023 respectively. Also, here we find a useful [guide on solving Windows Media Center not working on Windows 7/8/8.1](https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/mediatrans/), in case you encounter that problem.

#### **Go to the Windows 10 Media Center Alternatives Bandwagon:**

**Windows 10 Media Center Alternative 2: Mediaportal** 

With a built-in DVR, Mediaportal, forked from XBMC, is considered the closest thing to Windows Media Center for Windows 10 as an alternative since it can let you watch, schedule and record live TV(TiVo), [play music/radio](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/)/video etc. and has integrated weather forecasts and built-in RSS reader. However, MePo (1.12.0) at present only supports Windows OS up to 8.1, not even Windows 10 preview, so you may have to wait until MePo version 2.0 rolls out.

**Windows 10 Media Center Alternative 3: XBMC(KODI)**

KODI well handles live TV, audio/video/pictures, and supports millions of formats ranging from physical digital media like Blu-ray to network protocol clients like DLNA, UPnP, RTMP etc. to internet video streams and radio stations like streaming Netflix, Hulu, Veoh and [streaming Pandora](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/). However, it does not have built-in digital TV-tuner code of its own for Live TV or DVR/PVR recording utility, as instead it performs as an unified DVR/PVR front-end with an EPG TV-Guide GUI interface, which requires 3rd/4th party programs or add-ons.

**Windows 10 Media Center Alternative 4: Cost-Based Streaming Services** 

Cost-based streaming services, like [Netflix movies/TV shows streaming](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/), well known for its exclusive and abundant streaming content, yet does nothing for current broadcast shows and TV series compared with WMC. Forgo Hulu, which extracts money from you and lets you enjoy endless commercials!
