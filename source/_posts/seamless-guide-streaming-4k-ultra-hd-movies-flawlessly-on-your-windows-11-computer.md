Speaking of **how to play 4K video on Windows 10** successfully, the first thing you should make clear is what a 4K video is? Simply put, 4K has four times the number of pixels of the 1080p HD, thus it can render much higher image definition and more details of a video than the 1080p resolution. If you use a professional 4K video player for Windows 10 like 5KPlayer to play 4K UHD videos on your Windows 10 PC, the viewing experience would be much greater than before.

Besides, 4K UHD contents could be downloaded from online, ripped from DVDs or recorded by iPhone, GoPro, cameras or camcorders. Now that 4K resolutions and 4K videos are variable, your [4K video player](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) should be quite powerful to the whole types of 4K UHD contents on Windows 10 computer without lag.
