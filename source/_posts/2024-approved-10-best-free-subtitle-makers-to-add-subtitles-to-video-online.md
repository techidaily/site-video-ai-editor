#### 1\. Ocean Footage underwater sample

This one is first on my choice of 4K video sample for a couple of reasons, firstly I love the subject matter, and secondly from a technical perspective it is one of the best samples out there.

Filmed using a Red One camera, it displays the vibrancy and detail that we associate with 4K resolution at its best, the color depth of the fish and coral is astounding, and when the shot moves to a passing whale the sense of scale the resolution gives really shows what 4K is capable of, and why it is a step up from anything we have seen before.

#### 2\. Trailer for the movie ‘Elysium’

Very little movie production footage is easily available out there in 4K, but this is one of the exceptions. The full theatrical trailer for the movie in glorious Ultra HD, Why does this make the list? Well I think if you are wanting to see the benefits of 4K, then samples like the Ocean Footage one mentioned above really show off the technical prowess, but it is actual movies that most people will be wanting to use 4K kit for, and this gives you a very good indication of how much of an increase in clarity, detail and vibrancy can be gained by switching to 4K. The standard HD version of this trailer is readily available too, so this is something you could make a direct comparison with. The nature of the film, a sci-fi action film, also lends itself to 4K with lots of beautifully rendered CGI scenes in the trailer to look at.

### 3\. Timescapes

This is the trailer for an interesting project, filmed entirely in 4K and the work of one man, it is purported to be the first 4K film made available for sale. The film itself, and this trailer, is a simple concept, slow-motion and time lapse cinematography of the South West of America, taken as the director, Tom Lowe, travels around in his pickup truck. The concept itself makes for an interesting effect, but this sample is here because of the content. Watching the big expanses of nature flow by in 4K is simply mind blowing, here you really see the almost 3D effect so much resolution and detail bring to the medium, it isn’t like watching a video, it really is like looking out of a window at real life.

### 4\. Boat Scenes

There are actually several test videos on this subject, all of them do a good job of displaying 4K but for me it is the this one that focuses on passing boats against an expansive backdrop that is the one to look at. Again it shows the effect of 4K resolution when displaying the wider world around us, this time a harbor vista as the boat passes through it, detail can be seen in the water, the passengers on the boat and the backdrop, and the sense of realism and scale, which for me are the things that set 4K apart, are readily apparent here.

### 5\. Tears of Steel trailer

Another rare 4K movie trailer, this one again shows lots of very high quality CGI that really show off the capabilities of 4K at their best. Some great use of the depth of field that 4K emphasizes in a lot of the shots and overall provides a great insight into 4K and what you can expect from it. An interesting video that also manages to tell a little story as well as being a showcase.

### 6\. Sintel

Sintel is an animated short created in the blender animation program, here in 4K it represents a fantastic look into what 4K can offer all forms of media, the opening scene, with the snow blowing in the wind, for instance, enables you to see incredible detail that just isn’t visible within the standard HD version. Seeing individual flies as the character searches through the wreckage of a town is another high point in terms of technical prowess.

Another feature of Sintel is its soft focus look that accentuates the high resolution, and makes this video stand out from others in the list. The small dragon is well animated and the main characters features, particularly the hair, are incredibly well realized. A great way to showcase your 4K equipment.

### 7\. Stock Footage Sample

This one is an amalgam of short clips from commercial stock footage that is used a sample of the product. That doesn’t make it any less of a fantastic 4K clip however, with footage chosen specifically to show off the benefits of 4K at its very best (it is a promotional package after all) there is something here for everyone. From the glorious colors of a sunrise to the explosions and the amazing time lapse, with, again, fantastic and vibrant colors, a real showcase for 4K in the true sense of the word.

### 8\. Honey Bees

Back to nature for this one, and the eponymous Honey Bee. Showing not only the color rendition and detail of the surroundings, it also captures the Bees themselves in incredible fidelity, the wing detail, especially on the close-ups, is just way beyond anything we have seen from moving images before, high resolution stills? Certainly, but not video. Another great advert for 4K footage and a lovely film as well.

#### 9\. Skyfall Trailer

Can’t say I’m much of a fan of the films, but as a way to see what very fast action looks like in 4K this is a great one. Unlike the other movie trailers, this one isn’t full of CGI, so it shows a different aspect of 4K movies here, the real-life stunts performed by traditional stunt professionals is what this one is all about. And it doesn’t let us down, crashes, explosions and car chases, everything that Bond is about. Except in 4K. Great.

#### 10\. Fireworks

This one is just a lot of fun. Fireworks, in 4K. Color rendition, detail, it has it all. It opens with a magnificent view across the city showing the lights at dusk and beyond, and then into the stunning firework display, it really is quite spectacular and a great look at 4K footage.

That’s our top 10, not all the best technically, but each offers something a little different to give a taste of what 4K is all about, and exactly what your 4K screen is capable of.

There are multiple 4K video converters with powerful functions. However, if video converting is new to you, consider [Wondershare UniConverter](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/videoconverter/download/), which is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out.

#### 1\. Ocean Footage underwater sample

This one is first on my choice of 4K video sample for a couple of reasons, firstly I love the subject matter, and secondly from a technical perspective it is one of the best samples out there.

Filmed using a Red One camera, it displays the vibrancy and detail that we associate with 4K resolution at its best, the color depth of the fish and coral is astounding, and when the shot moves to a passing whale the sense of scale the resolution gives really shows what 4K is capable of, and why it is a step up from anything we have seen before.

#### 2\. Trailer for the movie ‘Elysium’

Very little movie production footage is easily available out there in 4K, but this is one of the exceptions. The full theatrical trailer for the movie in glorious Ultra HD, Why does this make the list? Well I think if you are wanting to see the benefits of 4K, then samples like the Ocean Footage one mentioned above really show off the technical prowess, but it is actual movies that most people will be wanting to use 4K kit for, and this gives you a very good indication of how much of an increase in clarity, detail and vibrancy can be gained by switching to 4K. The standard HD version of this trailer is readily available too, so this is something you could make a direct comparison with. The nature of the film, a sci-fi action film, also lends itself to 4K with lots of beautifully rendered CGI scenes in the trailer to look at.

### 3\. Timescapes

This is the trailer for an interesting project, filmed entirely in 4K and the work of one man, it is purported to be the first 4K film made available for sale. The film itself, and this trailer, is a simple concept, slow-motion and time lapse cinematography of the South West of America, taken as the director, Tom Lowe, travels around in his pickup truck. The concept itself makes for an interesting effect, but this sample is here because of the content. Watching the big expanses of nature flow by in 4K is simply mind blowing, here you really see the almost 3D effect so much resolution and detail bring to the medium, it isn’t like watching a video, it really is like looking out of a window at real life.

### 4\. Boat Scenes

There are actually several test videos on this subject, all of them do a good job of displaying 4K but for me it is the this one that focuses on passing boats against an expansive backdrop that is the one to look at. Again it shows the effect of 4K resolution when displaying the wider world around us, this time a harbor vista as the boat passes through it, detail can be seen in the water, the passengers on the boat and the backdrop, and the sense of realism and scale, which for me are the things that set 4K apart, are readily apparent here.

### 5\. Tears of Steel trailer

Another rare 4K movie trailer, this one again shows lots of very high quality CGI that really show off the capabilities of 4K at their best. Some great use of the depth of field that 4K emphasizes in a lot of the shots and overall provides a great insight into 4K and what you can expect from it. An interesting video that also manages to tell a little story as well as being a showcase.

### 6\. Sintel

Sintel is an animated short created in the blender animation program, here in 4K it represents a fantastic look into what 4K can offer all forms of media, the opening scene, with the snow blowing in the wind, for instance, enables you to see incredible detail that just isn’t visible within the standard HD version. Seeing individual flies as the character searches through the wreckage of a town is another high point in terms of technical prowess.

Another feature of Sintel is its soft focus look that accentuates the high resolution, and makes this video stand out from others in the list. The small dragon is well animated and the main characters features, particularly the hair, are incredibly well realized. A great way to showcase your 4K equipment.

### 7\. Stock Footage Sample

This one is an amalgam of short clips from commercial stock footage that is used a sample of the product. That doesn’t make it any less of a fantastic 4K clip however, with footage chosen specifically to show off the benefits of 4K at its very best (it is a promotional package after all) there is something here for everyone. From the glorious colors of a sunrise to the explosions and the amazing time lapse, with, again, fantastic and vibrant colors, a real showcase for 4K in the true sense of the word.

### 8\. Honey Bees

Back to nature for this one, and the eponymous Honey Bee. Showing not only the color rendition and detail of the surroundings, it also captures the Bees themselves in incredible fidelity, the wing detail, especially on the close-ups, is just way beyond anything we have seen from moving images before, high resolution stills? Certainly, but not video. Another great advert for 4K footage and a lovely film as well.

#### 9\. Skyfall Trailer

Can’t say I’m much of a fan of the films, but as a way to see what very fast action looks like in 4K this is a great one. Unlike the other movie trailers, this one isn’t full of CGI, so it shows a different aspect of 4K movies here, the real-life stunts performed by traditional stunt professionals is what this one is all about.

## Get Best Subtitle Edit for Mac Alternatives

# Subtitle Edit for Mac: Download Alternatives

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg)

##### Max Wales

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Subtitle Edit is a free, open-source subtitle editor that allows users to create, adjust, sync, and translate the subtitle lines seamlessly. But one of the significant drawbacks of Subtitle Edit is that it is available only for Windows users. Nevertheless, it does not mean that Mac users cannot utilize the same function and feature set. There exists some software that is almost similar to Subtitle Edit. And given that there is no option to download Subtitle Edit for Mac users — you can use its alternative and utilize the same features on a macOS environment.

Read on to find the best Subtitle Edit Alternative to download on Mac.

* [**Part 1: Top 3 Subtitle Edit Alternatives**](#part1)
* [**Part 2: Edit Subtitle And Video With Filmora**](#part2)

## Part 1: Top 3 Subtitle Edit Alternatives

After reviewing the tons of subtitle editors on the internet, we have composed a short but best list of the best alternatives of Subtitle Edit software for Mac users. And if you are used to Subtitle Edit and looking for a software that is likely comparable to mighty Subtitle Edit, you can ignore looking at this software. That said, here’s the list:

### 1\. Aegisub

Free, open-source, and cross-platform program, AegiSub is the best alternative of SubtitleEdit because the software is comparable in most standards to the software. In fact, by comparison, AegiSub is substantial compared to the one in question. Including a built-in real-time video preview option, Aegisub allows users to see the look of the text on the videos while editing them. There are multiple options to edit the subtitles; for instance, you can change the size, font, and language based on preference and set it to video with exact timestamps. And given the fact it is a free platform; it is definitely worth a look regardless of whether you like the software or not. For the most part, if you like Aegisub, you will love Subtitle Edit and will not find it tough to utilize Aegisub to edit the subtitles.

![ Aegisub](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subtitle-edit-alternarives-aegisub-1.jpg)

**Pros:**

* Free of costs — you can donate if you like the program
* Cross-platform — sign in with a single credentials on across all your devices and work anytime, anywhere
* Multiple style, size, and font options
* Built-in video preview to view the added subtitles

**Cons:**

* Interface needs improvement — instead of downloading the original version, try a version from Github that includes developed and enriched version of the software

**Price: Free software; no hidden fees**

### 2\. Jubler

Another free software, Jubler, is also a viable alternative to Subtitle Edit. Having all the features same as Subtitle Edit, Jubler has enough functions and capability to stand against it with its head held high. One of the most lovable qualities of Jubler is syncing text to match video features that allow users to sync the text to exact timestamps and avoid problems like latency. But that is not it: Jubler also includes an ‘Audio Wave’ feature to let you target different parts of the video and add subtitles conveniently and easily. In all, if you need a simple Subtitle editor for a Mac — Jubler is worth looking at and trying it out. Still, given that it has limited options when it comes to Formats, collaboration, and conversation options, Jubler stands next to AegiSub in our list of best alternatives of Subtitle Edit for Mac.

![Jubler](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subtitle-edit-alternarives-jubler-2.jpg)

**Pros:**

* Simple and navigable tool for Mac users to edit the subtitles, sync and match to video conveniently

**Cons:**

* Limited subtitles options available
* No online editor — downloading is must

**Price: Free software; no hidden fees**

### 3\. Subtitle Workshop

Supporting all the subtitle formats and incorporating all the tools that is ever expected from a subtitle editor, Subtitle Workshop accumulates the finest features into a simple and workable interface that allows users to add subtitles, edit, and sync & match to video easily. For instance, Subtitle Workshop allows you to handle both time and frame-based subtitles and edit them to perfection. The user-friendly, multi-lingual, and customizable interface is another likable trait that you will rarely find in the subtitle-editors realm. Not only this, but you can also utilize functions like Bold, Italics, and underline to add those subtle details and make the transcript look like a professional-edited one.

![Subtitle Workshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subtitle-edit-alternatives-subtitle-workshop-3.jpg)

**Pros:**

* Numerous customizable tools and functions for automatic timing and text manipulations. For instance, you will find automatic durations, spell checking, smart line adjusting, FPS conversion, search and replace, and many more!

**Cons:**

* No cross platform supports

**Price: Free to use; no hidden fees whatsoever**  

## Part 2: Edit Subtitle and Video with Filmora

If you are looking to edit videos and apply subtitles on a Mac computer, another considerable option is Wondershare’s Filmora. Including multiple edit options, Filmora allows you to add beautiful titles, subtitles, and text to a video or movie conveniently. Including all the features, Filmora allows video-editing novices to edit a video like a professional. The interface is straightforward and utilizing the application to its full extent will not be difficult for anyone, regardless of the fact whether they are experts or just starting out. And although a simple tool, Filmora includes all the powerful tools, including the Chroma Key, to work on a blue-or-green screen, add transitions, effects, and filters to the videos. Plus, you can add up to hundred layers of video and audio and create the most desirable video that tells the story exactly as you want it to.

* If you are looking for a perfect video cum subtitle editor that allows you to add tons of styles, font, and animation features to the text present on the videos, Filmora is worth looking at.
* It is a free-to-use application (premium available), you can try it out if you are looking for something along the lines of a subtitle editor.
* It includes other features to edit the video too and not just sync and match video to text (like the ones mentioned above), Filmora is the app that you need on Mac.

## Conclusion

Counting tons of other features Subtitle Edit includes in the program, it is not tough to see why it is one of the most popular subtitle editors in the Windows realm.
