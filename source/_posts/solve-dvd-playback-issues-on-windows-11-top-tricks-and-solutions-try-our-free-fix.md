**Windows 10 Can't Play DVD Free Anymore without WMC? Nonsense!**

Windows 7 reaches the ends of life, but after upgrading the operating system to Windows 10, Windows Media Center has indeed caused a lot trouble playing DVDs on Windows 10, but it doesn't mean **DVD won't play on Windows 10** anymore (since it is not the issue of an OS to blame), and neither do we have to purchase a Microsoft Windows DVD player at an absurd 14 dollars. Robust free DVD players for Windows 10 are almost everywhere with some even having supports for blu-ray. Find out high-quality Windows 10 DVD player here with us and learn how to play a DVD on Windows 10 free!

### Windows 10 Default DVD Player Not Working? How to Solve DVD Won't Play on Windows 10?

"_After a recent windows update, the dvd player stopped working. When I insert a dvd, the auto play opens and when I select dvd player the app tries to open then closes unexpectedly. I deleted the app, then paid $14.99 to re-install the app. The same thing occurred when I tried to play a dvd. I am running windows 10 32 bit._"  
"_Just how could MS a program (player) that is this bad. The first DVD player I have from 20 years ago had better controls than this app. MS should maybe feel bad about the program of sell it for $2 to match it unrefined performance._"  
"_Sucked, freezing up all the time_"  
"_Frames are jumpy and full of stutters. Then one day, it just stopped working all together._"

From many users' reviews on Microsoft official download site, [Windows DVD player](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) really falls short of its boast advertisement, scoring only 2.2 for its overall performance. Not to mention it has only two builds – x86 and x64 on Windows 10 at a cost of $14.99, Windows DVD player can merely be installed on up to ten Windows 10 devices with supports for 110 languages! Why bother purchasing a piece of crack like this to solve the DVD will not play on Windows 10 issue? Trust me. You can have your money better spent than this.
