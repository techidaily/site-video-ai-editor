 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

DVDs are not as nearly as popular as they were in the 2000s, simply because USB flash drives are much more durable than DVD discs. One of the easiest ways to back up the data stored on DVDs is to convert it to digital video file formats, like [MOV](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)or [MP4](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

You cannot just copy and paste the data from a DVD or Blu-ray to a computer since you need file conversion software in order to [change the format of a video file](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Read on if you are looking for a way to **convert a DVD to a digital video file format** because in this article we are going to take you through some of the **best DVD to digital format converters**.

## How to convert DVDs to Digital Video File Formats?

The process of [converting a video file](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is simple, and anyone can perform it in just a few minutes even if they have never done it before. However, converting DVDs to digital file formats without permission is punishable by the law, so you must make sure that you have the right to use the file you created freely. Let’s take a look at some of the best DVD to digital format converters.

### 1\. [Vudu](https://www.vudu.com/content/in%5Fhome%5Fdisc%5Fto%5Fdigital.html)

**Price:** $2 - $5 per conversion

**Compatibility:** Android, iOS

Having a source of entertainment in your pocket wherever you go can make dull long journeys much more fun. Vudu allows you to manage your film collection directly from your Smartphone and have access to all your DVD and Blu-ray discs at any moment.

![VUDU-convert](https://images.wondershare.com/videoconverter/player/movie-apps-ipad-vudu.jpg)

In order to start the conversion process, you just have to scan a disc’s barcode and the app will automatically convert it to a digital video file format. You can choose to convert a Blu-ray to HDX, DVD to SD or DVD to HDX, however, you will have to pay between $2 and $5 plus the tax for each file you convert with Vudu. Furthermore, the app features an impressive movie collection with more than 100,000 titles you can watch anytime and anywhere.

### 2\. [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows

This open-source file converter can help you convert any DVD to a file format you choose effortlessly. PC users that have Windows 7 or later can install HandBrake for free, although the application only works on 64-bit versions of the OS.

You can choose from a variety of device presets that automatically adjust the conversion settings to a device on which the converted DVD video is going to be played. In addition, HandBrake lets you choose the output file format, set the preferred [framerate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)or [apply video filters](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) such as [Denoise](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), Grayscale or Deinterlacing. Nonetheless, HandBrake can only convert DVDs to MP4 or MKV file formats, which can considerably limit your conversion options.

### 3\. [Wondershare Uniconverter](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/videoconverter/download/)

**Price:** Freemium, $55.99 for the perpetual plan

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS

If you are looking for a software product that enables you to burn DVDs, edit or transfer videos and convert them to more than a thousand video file formats, then Wondershare Unicoverter is undoubtedly one of the best choices you have at your disposal.

You should keep in mind that the free version of Wondershare Uniconverter only lets you convert 1/3 of the output file and prevents recording videos that are longer than one minute.

### 4\. [DVDVideoSoft Free Video Converter](https://www.dvdvideosoft.com/products/dvd/Free-DVD-Video-Converter.htm)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows

This is a simple tool that makes the process of converting a DVD to a digital video or audio file effortless.

[Extracting audio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) from DVD is yet another option DVDVideo Soft Free Video Converter provides, which enables you to extract dialogue or narration from video files. Even so, the software can only convert unprotected files, so you must make sure that the DVD you are trying to convert doesn’t have regional protection or any other form of encryption.

### 5\. [DVDFab DVD Ripper](https://www.dvdfab.cn/dvd-ripper.htm)

**Price:** Free version available, pricing options start at $69

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS

The range of the file conversion options this tool provides depends on the subscription model you’ve selected.

Furthermore, you won’t have access to 4K and  profiles and you will only get a free DVD Ripper account.

Both Full Trial and Paid versions of this DVD converter let you export multichannel audio files, but the free version limits the number of audio channels to just two. The [resolution of the output videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) cannot be higher than 480p regardless of the subscription model you choose, but you can purchase the Enlarger AI app separately and use it to upscale the videos up to 1080p.

### 6\. [WinX DVD Ripper Platinum](https://www.winxdvd.com/dvd-ripper-platinum/)

**Price:** $59.95

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

Backing up old DVDs, fixing playback errors on DVDs, or ripping a DVD to MP4 are some of the most common reasons why PC and Mac users choose to convert their DVDs with WinX DVD Ripper Platinum.

![winx-dvd](https://images.wondershare.com/videoconverter/article/2017/01/14852341013478.jpg)
