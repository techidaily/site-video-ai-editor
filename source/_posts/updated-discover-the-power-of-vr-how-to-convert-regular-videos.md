 **User Rating:** 4.7

KineMaster is a **professional video editing app** that enables users to trim a video frame by frame, apply the Chroma Key effect or add 3D transitions between video clips. That's why it is not surprising that iPhone and Android users can easily blur faces in their videos with this app. However, the free version of KineMaster provides you with only a limited amount of options, and you have to make a series of in-app purchases to unlock all the features this app has to offer.

You have to pick one of the options and designate the screen area you'd like to blur, and the app will do the rest for you. However, you can't zoom into a photo, which means that you won't have a great deal of control over the face blurring process in certain situations. The Mosaic Pixelate Censor Photo doesn't offer any other photo editing options, which makes it a good choice only if you're looking for an efficient tool that lets you censor photos quickly.

Learn more details about [How to blur faces in iMovie](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Even though iMovie offers a rich selection of video editing options, unfortunately, there are no options that enable you to blur or pixelate a face. To conceal a beginning or an object in a video, you'll have toadd a non-transparent layer over the area of the video you'd like to hide. This is by no means an elegant solution since adding a monochrome rectangle over a video can completely ruin its visual appeal. Using iMovie to conceal faces in videos is only a good option if, for whatever reason, you can't install any other app that grants you more control over the process of blurring faces in videos.

#### 10. Blur&Mosaic

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/video-toolbox-movie-maker/id892281503?mt=8)

![Video Toolbox Movie Maker Mosaic App for iOS ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-toolbox-movie-maker-app.jpg)

The video editing tools this iOS-based app offers will enable you to create professional-looking social media videos. There are over thirty transitions to choose from and more than twenty video effects. You can experiment with the Green Screen feature to combine two or more clips into a single video or try out the Reverse video option. Despite a solid number of video editing options, Video Toolbox offers only a limited number of face blurring options. The pixelate or blur effect you add to a video will be static, so if your subject moves a lot, you will have to use another app.

#### 4. MovStash

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/movstash/id1058281885?mt=8https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEkPbV2Ptzo)

**User Rating:**  3.7

![Movstash  Mosaic Blur App for iOS ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/movstash-mosaic-blur-video-app.jpg)

There are four types of blur you can choose from, and you can edit your videos in Simple and Timeline modes. You can specify the area of the shot you'd like to blur manually and use the slider to set the intensity of the blur effect. The Timeline mode lets you add as many blur areas to a video as you want so that you can blur multiple faces in a single shot. MovStash is specifically designed to make the process of blurring portions of a video quick and simple, but the app **doesn't offer any other video editing option.**

#### 5. KineMaster – Pro Video Editor

**Price:** Free, offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kinemaster-pro-video-editor/id1223932558?mt=8), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nexstreaming.app.kinemasterfree&hl=en%5FGB)

 **User Rating:** 4.7

KineMaster is a **professional video editing app** that enables users to trim a video frame by frame, apply the Chroma Key effect or add 3D transitions between video clips. That's why it is not surprising that iPhone and Android users can easily blur faces in their videos with this app. However, the free version of KineMaster provides you with only a limited amount of options, and you have to make a series of in-app purchases to unlock all the features this app has to offer.

#### 6. Blur Photos

You can blur the faces in your photos using the **Mosaic, Pixelate, Blur, or Color options**. You have to pick one of the options and designate the screen area you'd like to blur, and the app will do the rest for you. However, you can't zoom into a photo, which means that you won't have a great deal of control over the face blurring process in certain situations. The Mosaic Pixelate Censor Photo doesn't offer any other photo editing options, which makes it a good choice only if you're looking for an efficient tool that lets you censor photos quickly.

#### 8. Point Blur

Learn more details about [How to blur faces in iMovie](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Even though iMovie offers a rich selection of video editing options, unfortunately, there are no options that enable you to blur or pixelate a face. To conceal a beginning or an object in a video, you'll have toadd a non-transparent layer over the area of the video you'd like to hide. This is by no means an elegant solution since adding a monochrome rectangle over a video can completely ruin its visual appeal. Using iMovie to conceal faces in videos is only a good option if, for whatever reason, you can't install any other app that grants you more control over the process of blurring faces in videos.

#### 10. Blur&Mosaic

**Price:** Free, offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blur-mosaic/id964220645?mt=8)
