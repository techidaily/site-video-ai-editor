## Part3: FAQs of Adobe Premiere Pro for Mac

#### 1\. Can Adobe Premiere Pro run natively on M1 Macs?

Yes! Adobe Premiere Pro for Mac now runs natively on the M1 kind. Furthermore, Adobe Premiere Pro runs 80% quicker on M1.

#### 2\. Can a MacBook Air run Adobe Premiere Pro?

Of course, Yes! MacBook Air has indeed experienced swift running of Premiere Pro unless you try to extend it with the 4K editing. For 4k and above rendering, MacBook Air runs down, and sometimes it gets exhausted dealing with the longer time frames for the rendering process.

## Final Words

Adobe Premiere Pro for Mac is the widely-used video editor among professional video content creators. Even though it is powerful enough to make your videos look like what you can imagine, it is not easy to master it even for professionals, not mention beginners and intermediates.
