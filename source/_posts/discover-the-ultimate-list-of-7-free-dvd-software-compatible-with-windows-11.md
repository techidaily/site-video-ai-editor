GOM Player can generally handle a plenty of DVD discs on Windows 10 system. However, there are chances that you encounter DVD won't play and playback problems using GOM DVD player on Windows 10\. FFDSHOW codec/filter/DVD drive's region code settings might be the incentives. You can solve those problems easily under the guidance of GOMLAB. The other highlight of this player is its newly added 360 VR video playback ability, which allows you to watch trendy videos 360 degrees around easily.

![GOM Player Plays DVD](https://www.5kplayer.com/video-music-player/img/gom-player2.jpg) 

**Note:** Though there are also people suggesting that if you upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 8, Windows Media Player still works fine for DVD playback on Windows 10\. It's not exactly the reason. The thing is, if your computer has a DVD drive and it already has a compatible DVD decoder installed in it, you can play DVDs using whichever DVD player you want. MS just stops paying for the DVD patents owned by MPEG LA by not providing media player software with built-in DVD decoders, to be clear -- "Windows Media Player can play audio CDs, data CDs, and data DVDs that contain music or video files (also known as media CDs). You can also play video CDs (VCDs), which are similar to DVDs, but not DVDs."

Therefore, although the above free Windows 10 DVD players have built-in DVD codecs, it will be THEORATICALLY considered criminal doings using them to watch DVDs by DMCA in the US. Good luck!
