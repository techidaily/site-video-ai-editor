2. Access the **Effects** tab, and then click **Video Effects,** and then **Stylize**.
3. Click **Mosaic**.
4. Go to the **Effects Control** tab, and pick the shape of blurred area. The elliptical and 4-point polygon mask options are what most people use when blurring faces in particular.
5. Drag the **Mask** over the intended area
6. Adjust **Positioning**, **Scale**, **and**/**or Rotation** to your liking.
7. You can fine-tune the effect further by adjusting the **Mask Expansion,** the **Horizontal and Vertical** blocks the mosaic effect is composed of, and the **Feather**

What sort of video editing software you go for when you want to edit the face in videos is ultimately up to you - we’ve only expressed our personal preferences in the hopes that it might help some of the people that are interested in the subject. Most of the steps present in this list are similar to each other and you will find that once you learn how to do this trick, you will become far more familiarized with all the various effects available to you.
