#### **Is SPlayer Windows 10 the Very Free Video Player You're Looking For?**

By and large, SPlayer has become much welcomed by Windows 10 users on tablet/Surface Pro, or others who wish to expand the navigation duration. This video player, highly CPU-efficient and lightweight, is probably a no brainer for any entertaining purpose.

An all-you-can-eat codec range in SPlayer Windows 10 allows you to play MP4, MKV, AVI videos without strain, watching movies on this smaller-than-most video player is as glossy as with anything else. However, here're some small flaws you have to live with. Read the review to find out:

★ **5 Reasons to Download SPlayer for Windows 10**

☆ Intuitive GUI based on Media Player Classic-HC;  
 ☆ Personalized playback panel size - support erasing black bars for video only;  
 ☆ Stylistic software skin design: SPlayer offers 3 GUI options - choose default background/choose a visual picture from computer/the Aero glass effect that let you set the desktop background as SPlayer's skin;  
 ☆ Manually switch between High Picture Quality Mode and High Performance Mode (for aged computers) to guarantee glossy playback;  
 ☆ In-class subtitle support: Works with opensubtitles.org to fetch & load files. 

**Tips:** By the time you have finished SPlayer Windows 10 full version free download, it's quite likely you'll be puzzled by the Chinese paper works and GUI. Many a user has doubts on the paperwork content since there's no English version available, that's actually no big issue. 

But you should be acknowledged that SPlayer Windows 10, or Shooter Player Windows 10 is developed by a Chinese team based on Media Player Classic - HC. That being said, it's most likely to be accepted by the Chinese environment, instead of U.S., U.K., India, and other Asian countries.

★ **3 Reasons You Shouldn't Download SPlayer for Windows 10**
