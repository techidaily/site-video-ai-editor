There are two broad categories of effects in Final Cut Pro X: Inspector effects and Effects Browser effects.

I've written previously about how to use Inspector effects to create a [picture-in-picture](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) effect, among many other effects available to us in Final Cut Pro. In this article, I want to show you how to apply an effect to a clip, modify that effect, temporarily turn that effect on or off, or delete it entirely.

This is a basic tutorial about Apple Final Cut Pro X, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). This is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out. Download the free trial version below.

## How to Apply Effects to Video in Final Cut Pro X

* [Find and apply an effect](#part1)
* [Modify an effect](#part2)
* [Disable and delete an effect](#part3)
* [Extra credit](#part4)

#### Find and apply an effect

Here is our clip - a fearsome polar bear.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx001.jpg "add effects in fcp")

To apply an effect, first select the clip in the Timeline.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx002.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Then, click this icon in the Toolbar to open the Effects Browser (or type Cmd + 5).

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx003.jpg "add effects in fcp")

The Browser, like all the effects browsers, lists categories of effects on the left, a search box at the bottom to use for searching for the names of effects, and effects for each category on the right.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx004.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Here, for example, I've selected the Blur category, with my cursor near the Gaussian blur effect. (Gaussian blur is the best effect to use when you want a clip to look blurry.)

To apply an effect, do one of two things:

* Drag the effect from the Browser onto the clip you want to change.
* If the clip, or clips, are selected, double-click the effect in the Browser to apply it.

#### Modify an effect

To modify an effect, click this icon in the Toolbar to open the Inspector (or type Cmd + 4).

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx005.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Click the Video tab in the Inspector. Effects from the Effects Browser are always listed at the top of the Inspector.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx006.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Grab a slider and drag it to see what happens. For example, to make an image blurrier, drag the Amount slider to the right. To lessen the effect, drag it to the left.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx007.jpg "add effects in fcp")

#### Disable and delete an effect

To temporarily disable an effect, without deleting it, click the blue box so that it turns gray.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx008.jpg "add effects in fcp")

To enable an effect, click the gray box so it turns blue again.

To delete an effect, click the name of the effect - in this example: Gaussian - and press the big Delete key.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx009.jpg "add effects in fcp")

The effect will be deleted from the selected clip.

#### Extra credit

You can apply, modify, even delete the same effect to multiple clips by first selecting all the clips you want to change in the Timeline then adding, changing the settings, or deleting an effect in the Inspector.

#### Summary

The process of applying effects is the same for all effects you apply from the Effects Browser. In future articles I'll show you how to use this technique to create a wide variety of different effects in Final Cut Pro X.

## Unlocking the Potential of Your Sony Camcorder: Video Editing Essentials

# How to Edit Videos Shot by Sony Digital Camcorder

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

##### Ollie Mattison

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Making videos and shooting short films has been growing in popularity for several reasons, among them the proliferation of high-traffic sharing sites like YouTube, and the increased availability of professional quality camcorders and video devices. It's very easy today to become proficient enough to shoot high-quality videos for entertainment, for business and to assist with teaching. Sony is one of the brands that are popular with video makers, and in this tutorial we walk you through the steps on editing videos shot by Sony camcorder.

## How to Edit Videos Shot by Sony Digital Camcorder

### Video editing software for Sony camcorder

Video editing software is tiered by level, with options available for basic, mediate, and advanced programs. Here's a closer look at select software options:

* [Basic Editing Software for Sony Digital Camcorders](#part1)
* [Mediate Editing Software for Sony Digital Camcorders](#part2)
* [Advanced Editing Software for Sony Digital Camcorders](#part2)

### Basic Editing Software for Sony Digital Camcorders

#### 1\. Wondershare Filmora

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) (Latest version X) is not only one of the most affordable video editing software options, it's also one of the most advanced. The interface is simple, but there are numerous advanced features available, including overlays, filters, audio editing features and more.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 2\.  Windows Movie Maker

It comes free with Windows, is designed with ease-of-use in mind and offers a surprisingly robust package of features. Convenience and simplicity make Windows Movie Maker the top free video editing software.

![video editor for sony camcorder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-movie-maker-reverse-video-add.jpg)

[See how to edit videos with Windows Movie Maker here.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### Mediate Editing Software for Sony Digital Camcorders

#### 1\. Magix Movie Edit Pro

It excels in areas of advanced features, formats supported and attractive interface. However, it loses points for slow rendering performance and some complexity in the interface. The low price makes the exchange worth it for many users.

![video editor for sony camcorder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/magix-video-pro-interface.jpg)

#### 2\. Lightworks

It has an extensive list of features and capabilities that provide as near to professional performance as you can find in a free video editing program. The learning curve is a little steep, but if you're willing to invest the time then you have access to a powerful program.

![video editor for sony camcorder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lightworks.jpg)

### Advanced Editing Software for Sony Digital Camcorders

#### 1\. Movie Studio 13 Suite

It is from Sony, so you can expect that it works well with Sony digital camcorders. The interface is more inviting than is usually the case with a product aimed at professionals and the roster of advanced features is top-notch. Other than the price, there are very few drawbacks to this product.

![video editor for sony camcorder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/movie-studio.jpg)

**Final tip**: Understand what you want and balance your needs against your budget and your interest in learning a new application, then you will be able to select the best software to edit videos shot on your Sony camcorder.

## How to edit videos shot by Sony camcorder

How easy is it to edit videos shot by Sony digital camcorder? This easy:

* **Step 1**: Shoot your video
* **Step 2**: Transfer the video from camcorder to computer (using either USB connection or using the SD card).
* **Step 3**: Use video editing software to edit your video on the computer.

Steps 1 and 2 are so easy they need no explanation. Step 3 is where you might need some help and some explanation of your options for editing videos shot by Sony digital camcorder is worthwhile.

There is no need to spend money on a movie trailer maker since the video editing software you’re using to edit the footage can also be used to create trailers for videos you are working on. Even so, there are so many different video editing software products for Macs and PCs, that finding the one that is best suited for your video editing needs can be difficult. That is why in this article we are going to take you through the ten best trailer makers for Mac and Windows operating systems.

So, let’s take a look at what best movie trailer makers for Mac and PC have to offer.

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** macOS, iOS

Mac, iPhone and iPad users have a free and easy solution at their disposal if they want to make movie trailers. Besides offering basic video editing tools that enable you to edit your footage quickly, iMovie also features a collection of trailer templates. So, all you need to do in order to make a movie trailer is to add the video clips and insert the title of the movie, the director’s name and create the end credits.

None of the movie trailer templates you can find in iMovie allow you to add music to them, although you can create the soundtrack for your trailer from iMovie’s Movie mode. Furthermore, the templates can limit the maximum duration of your trailer, which is why you must make sure that the video clips you want to use match the duration of the trailer you selected.

Want to know the details? Check the detailed guide about [how to make a movie trailer with iMovie](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

### 2\. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### 3\. [VSDC Free Video Editor](http://www.videosoftdev.com/free-video-editor)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows

You won’t need much time to get used to VSDC’s interface even if you don’t have any previous video editing experience.

Moreover, making a movie trailer with VSDC is remarkably easy, as you just have to arrange the footage on the timeline, apply visual effects and create an opener and the end credits. The software doesn’t offer templates, which means that you have to go through this process manually. VSDC lets you choose from a variety of export profiles that optimize your movie trailers for playback on Instagram, Facebook, and other social media platforms.

### 5\. [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html)

Sadly, Final Cut Pro X doesn’t offer movie trailer templates, although you can save all your projects, which enables you to create your own movie trailer templates. In case you don’t have a lot of video editing experience, it is better to opt for a movie trailer maker that doesn’t require you to have an advanced set of video editing skills.

### 7\. [Avid Media Composer](https://www.avid.com/media-composer)

**Price:** Free, pricing plans start at $23.99

Unsurprisingly, this video editing software is compatible with a broad range of audio and video plugins that extend its capabilities even further.

## Video Editing Tips to Help you Make Better Movie Trailers

Making a movie trailer is an art, since telling a story of an entire movie in just a few minutes is never easy. Even though most Hollywood trailers look alike, there is no fixed recipe you have to follow while making a movie trailer for your project. However, there a few guidelines that can help you convey the core messages of your movie to the audience.

### 1\. Don’t Reveal Too Much

A movie trailer only needs to suggest what the movie is about, not tell its entire story. That’s why adopting the Less is More rule can be quite helpful during the process of making a movie trailer. Show just enough to spark the audience’s curiosity, because if you reveal too much they might feel as if they have already seen the best parts of your movie.

### 2\. Find Creative Ways to Use Narration and Text

Giving the audience all the information they need solely through images isn’t always possible, which is the reason why nearly all movie trailers have a narrator. Recording a voiceover and using text to convey the information about the movie to the audience will make the trailer more informative and a better promotional tool.

### 3\. Make a Soundtrack

Sound can give rhythm to a movie trailer, but it can also build suspense or suggest that something horrible is about to happen, which is why you shouldn’t hesitate to add audio effects or music to movie trailers you are making. The sound effects and the music must match the video perfectly in order for your trailer to be effective, which is the reason why you should dedicate special attention to the trailer’s soundtrack.

**Conclusion**

The key concepts of making a movie trailer are always the same, regardless of the video editing software you’re using. Each movie trailer maker we featured in this article offers more than enough video editing tools to make a dynamic and captivating movie trailer, but how you are going to use these tools entirely depends on the demands of your project. Which movie trailer maker are you going to choose? Share your opinions with us in the comments.

## Video Editing Tips to Help you Make Better Movie Trailers

Making a movie trailer is an art, since telling a story of an entire movie in just a few minutes is never easy. Even though most Hollywood trailers look alike, there is no fixed recipe you have to follow while making a movie trailer for your project. However, there a few guidelines that can help you convey the core messages of your movie to the audience.

### 1\. Don’t Reveal Too Much

A movie trailer only needs to suggest what the movie is about, not tell its entire story. That’s why adopting the Less is More rule can be quite helpful during the process of making a movie trailer. Show just enough to spark the audience’s curiosity, because if you reveal too much they might feel as if they have already seen the best parts of your movie.

### 2\. Find Creative Ways to Use Narration and Text

Giving the audience all the information they need solely through images isn’t always possible, which is the reason why nearly all movie trailers have a narrator. Recording a voiceover and using text to convey the information about the movie to the audience will make the trailer more informative and a better promotional tool.

### 3\. Make a Soundtrack

Sound can give rhythm to a movie trailer, but it can also build suspense or suggest that something horrible is about to happen, which is why you shouldn’t hesitate to add audio effects or music to movie trailers you are making. The sound effects and the music must match the video perfectly in order for your trailer to be effective, which is the reason why you should dedicate special attention to the trailer’s soundtrack.

**Conclusion**

The key concepts of making a movie trailer are always the same, regardless of the video editing software you’re using. Each movie trailer maker we featured in this article offers more than enough video editing tools to make a dynamic and captivating movie trailer, but how you are going to use these tools entirely depends on the demands of your project. Which movie trailer maker are you going to choose? Share your opinions with us in the comments.

Post-production always takes time regardless of how large or small your project is, but that doesn’t mean you can’t start promoting your movie before you complete it. In fact, filmmakers have been using movie trailers for years to inform the audience about their upcoming projects.

That is why in this article we are going to take you through the ten best trailer makers for Mac and Windows operating systems.

## Best Movie Trailer Software for PC and Mac Computers

Mastering a short video form like a movie trailer takes a lot of practice, as you only have a limited amount of time to tell your story.

None of the movie trailer templates you can find in iMovie allow you to add music to them, although you can create the soundtrack for your trailer from iMovie’s Movie mode. Furthermore, the templates can limit the maximum duration of your trailer, which is why you must make sure that the video clips you want to use match the duration of the trailer you selected.
