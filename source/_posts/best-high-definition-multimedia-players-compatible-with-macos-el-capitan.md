## No.3 Best HD Video Player for Mac El Capitan – DivX

Divx player is a simple and lovely HD video player for Mac El Capitan. And there are basically two highlights of Divx. First, It features HD 4K playback and is optimized for movies, TV shows and web videos in most popular formats, including AVI, DIVX, MKV, MP4 and more. Second, Its streaming feature also allows you to stream videos, music and photos to any DLNA-compatible device –PS3, Xbox, Chromecast, etc. The free version you downloaded cannot be upgraded for free. They will have to pay for upgrade and the endless ads on the screen are really annoying.

## No.4 Best HD Video Player for Mac El Capitan – MPlayerX

Offering free HEVC H.264 playback and support for MKV/M4V/AVI etc, [MplayerX is actually having issues with El Capitan](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/). The highlight of this Mac HD media player is that it can fuse with your MacBook, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air perfectly. You can control the playback by pinching, tapping or swipe on the touchpad of the laptop. MplayerX will always follow your gestures. MplayerX can also output raw DTS/AC3 stream to your TV with SPDIF cable plugged-in, which can be one of many ways to build a home theater. But be aware that MplayerX adware behaves like malware that tricks to foil analysis. Therefore, you may want to check that out before installation. 

Mac built-in HD media player Quick Time can only open several HD media files such as MP4, MOV, M4V etc, and surely cannot play files in WMV, MKV, DIVx, FLV, .rm, .rmvb,. What if you want to find a free HD video player for Mac? If you want to play HD movies in MPEG-2, you'll even have to purchase QT MPEG-2 Playback Component sold separately at the App store. And QuickTime 7 and the QuickTime Pro upgrade are not free of charge. That's damn crazy to spend money on just playing MPEG-2 and for other functions. Therefore, here, we'll list 4 most recommended robust and popular HD media players for your Mac Yosemite and El Capitan (OS X 10.11.4 and before) to play almost any file format.
