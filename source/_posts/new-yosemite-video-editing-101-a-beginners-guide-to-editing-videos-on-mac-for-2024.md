**User Review**

FlexClip being an online video editor means one thing; it does not use your PC's processing power. It also delivers what it promises. A [G2 reviewe](https://www.g2.com/products/flexclip/reviews/flexclip-review-5138003)r says, "I have used many video editing tools so far, but none is close to FlexClip when it comes to video editing."

**Takeaway**

You can't go wrong with FlexClip. It has powerful tools making it a great iMovie alternative for Windows. You don't even have to install it; it's an online tool. Unfortunately, that has some downsides. You need to wait for the website to finish loading before working because it scrolls down for each line that gets loaded.

### 8\. [Lightworks](https://lwks.com/)

Lightworks Pro is a video editor used to make some Oscar-winning films, and Lightworks is a free and less complicated version of it. However, Lightworks is still not that beginner-friendly. Therefore, it's best to consider this as an iMovie alternative only if you are an intermediate user.

![lightworks interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/10/imovie-for-windows-11-5.jpg)

**Key Features**

* Advanced Color Correction
* Some advanced tools
* Tooltips to help you learn how to use the features
* Integration to Cloud services
* Keyframing
* Advanced audio controls
* Autosave

**Price**

Lightworks is free, but premium subscriptions for Lightworks Create costs $99.9, and Lightworks Pro costs $24.99.

 Pros

* Includes Advanced tools
* You would not lose progress because of the autosave feature
* Good performance

 Cons

* Not suited for beginners
* You can only export up to 720p using the free version

**G2 Rating: 3.5 Stars**

**Supported OS** [Windows](https://lwks.com/), [Mac](https://lwks.com/), [Linux](https://lwks.com/)

**User Review**

A [TrustRadius Ratings and Review](http://trustradi.us/A9272) says, "Lightworks is a great tool for a non-designer to use because it provides a number of tools and capabilities that can be quickly learned." However, they note that Lightworks does not provide advanced video editors with all the tools they need. It's best for intermediate users.

**Takeaway**

Lightworks is a fantastic alternative to iMovie for Windows 10+ users. However, it requires you to be quite knowledgeable about video editing tools. This editor has a slightly higher learning curve than others. But once you learn how to use Lightworks, creating quality videos would be super easy.

### 9\. [Flexclip - Easy-to-Use Online Editor](https://www.flexclip.com/)

![flexclip interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/10/imovie-for-windows-11-2.jpg)

**Key Features**

* Dozens of useful tools like background remover and gif maker
* Voice and screen recorder
* Integration with social media platforms

**Supported OS:** [Windows](https://www.flexclip.com/)[,](https://www.flexclip.com/)[Mac](https://www.flexclip.com/), [Linux](https://www.flexclip.com/)

**User Review**

FlexClip being an online video editor means one thing; it does not use your PC's processing power. It also delivers what it promises. A [G2 reviewe](https://www.g2.com/products/flexclip/reviews/flexclip-review-5138003)r says, "I have used many video editing tools so far, but none is close to FlexClip when it comes to video editing."

**Takeaway**

You can't go wrong with FlexClip. It has powerful tools making it a great iMovie alternative for Windows. You don't even have to install it; it's an online tool. Unfortunately, that has some downsides. You need to wait for the website to finish loading before working because it scrolls down for each line that gets loaded.

### 10\. [WeVideo - Best for Templates](https://www.wevideo.com/)

WeVideo includes social-media-friendly templates, making it a fantastic choice for editing popular video categories like How-to, Unboxings, and Makeup tutorials.

**Takeaway**

WeVideo is a solid alternative for iMovie for Windows 10/11, but only if you are willing to pay. The free version has lots of restrictions. For example, you can only export 5 minutes of content per month.

### 11\. [OpenShot - Best for Amateurs](https://www.openshot.org/)

![openshot interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/10/imovie-for-windows-11-1.jpg)

OpenShot has a straightforward interface, making it beginner-friendly. It has some fantastic tools you'll find helpful. There's a catch with beginner-friendly editors, though. They don't have the advanced features you can find on other video editors. You can say that for OpenShot.

**Key Features**

* 3D Animation
* Text Editor
* Keyframing
* Decent selection of templates and filters

**Price:** Free

 Pros

* Beginner-friendly

**Takeaway**

Some tools are intimidating for beginners; there are many buttons, and you don't know what each one does. That's not a problem when using OpenShot. Its simple interface is easy to understand, making it the best tool for beginners.
