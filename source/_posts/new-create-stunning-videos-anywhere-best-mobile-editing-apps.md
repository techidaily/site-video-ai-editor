Have you noticed how certain old movies play with black padding on either side of the screen while watching the television?

![aspect ratio calculators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-5-aspect-ratio-calculator-online-1.jpg)

With this guide of the best five **aspect ratio calculators online** we've put together for you, you cannot go wrong!

#### In this article

01 [Typical Aspect Ratios and Sizes of Screens and Videos](#Part 1)

02 [How Do I Know the Aspect Ratio of My Video?](#Part 2)

03 [How Can I Change the Aspect Ratio of an Image Online?](#Part 3)

04 [How to Change the Aspect Ratio in Filmora/Filmora Pro?](#Part 4)

## Part 1 Part 1: Typical Aspect Ratios and Sizes of Screens and Videos

An aspect ratio is a measurement representing the ratio between the width and height of a screen or a video. It determines the length of your video or screen. Not only screens and videos, but you can use the concept also in images.

And, it is written as 'x:y' where 'x' is the width and 'y' is the height.

There isn't any one-size-fits-all when we need to use the video aspect ratios. Aspect ratios are generally selected based on where the video will post, how it will be visible, and what aim it usually serves.

Videos utilized for social media will vary from trailers shows or movies shown in theaters. There are common aspect ratios for modern televisions, but broadcasters can consider using the aspect ratio that operates great with their audience and content.

Since most videos showcase through standard online video platforms, custom aspect ratios are not commonly used.

Here are a few standard aspect ratios that you can use for live streaming and other video creation:

![aspect ratios](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-5-aspect-ratio-calculator-online-2.jpg)

**16:9**

A 16:9 aspect ratio represents a wide rectangle. It is also called "1.71:1," the most accessible form of the ratio, mathematically speaking.

This ratio is mainly used in video creation and streaming and is considered the international standard format for cinema and television.

Many also tend to use this highly famous aspect ratio on their sites.

It is also more cost-effective to use screens compatible with this ratio instead of their predecessors. The standardization of computer monitors and televisions saved producers both the money and time spent in the research field.

One of the ideal resolutions you can use with a 16:9 aspect ratio is 4Kor 3840 pixels by 2160 pixels.

**1:1**

The 1:1 video aspect ratio is one of the ideal squares used with square television sets.

It is much less in demand but usually visible on social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram.

Many cameras still have a square setting even though it's not the most commonly used aspect ratio.

**4:3**

The 4:3 aspect ratio was the general screen size for computer monitors and televisions before 16:9 and 16:10\. The reason for the switch was the HDTV birth. It's because the 16:9 and 16:10 aspect ratios allow for better resolutions than 4:3 do.

This aspect ratio was still considered for Apple iPads until they released the 2018 iPad Pro.

**3:2**

The 3:2 aspect ratio was primarily seen in classic 35 mm still photography still used on tablets, laptops, and various game consoles in the handheld form.

Many micro- to medium-sized cameras still use the 3:2 aspect ratio settings, but broadcasters rarely use it today.

**21:9**

The 21:9 aspect ratios have a pretty specific purpose. It is often called cinematic widescreen or ultra-widescreen.

It is also helpful for films with an anamorphic format. Anamorphic format videos create an optical illusion that offers a 360-degree view.

You are likely to look for the videos with this aspect ratio in notable museums, theme parks, theaters, and the like.

**9:16**

A 9:16 aspect ratio is for tall videos. This aspect ratio became famous after the launch of smartphones with video capabilities.

For instance, the optimal measure for an Instagram story is 1080 px by 1920 px, and thus its ratio comes out as 9:16\. The same goes for other famous apps with "story" features, including Snapchat and Facebook.

This makes sense because the iPhone camera's video setting can record footage in both 16:9 and 9:16.

## Part 2 How Do I Know the Aspect Ratio of My Video?

![aspect ratios](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-5-aspect-ratio-calculator-online-3.jpg)

Most cameras with video capabilities are available with various aspect ratio settings. This helps you decide which aspect ratio you'd like your video to have before recording it.

If you are looking to determine the aspect ratio of a video already shot, you can easily access additional information for the file.

The information button is a small "i" in a circle on Mac. Move on to right-click a file and select "**Properties**" on your PC.

It may give you the actual width and height of the video, but you can divide the two to find the aspect ratio.

However, you don't need to hassle as we'll enlist the best five **aspect ratio** **calculators online** below.

03 [How Can I Change the Aspect Ratio of an Image Online?](#Part 3)

04 [How to Change the Aspect Ratio in Filmora/Filmora Pro?](#Part 4)

## Part 1 Part 1: Typical Aspect Ratios and Sizes of Screens and Videos

An aspect ratio is a measurement representing the ratio between the width and height of a screen or a video. It determines the length of your video or screen. Not only screens and videos, but you can use the concept also in images.

And, it is written as 'x:y' where 'x' is the width and 'y' is the height.

There isn't any one-size-fits-all when we need to use the video aspect ratios. Aspect ratios are generally selected based on where the video will post, how it will be visible, and what aim it usually serves.

Videos utilized for social media will vary from trailers shows or movies shown in theaters. There are common aspect ratios for modern televisions, but broadcasters can consider using the aspect ratio that operates great with their audience and content.

Since most videos showcase through standard online video platforms, custom aspect ratios are not commonly used.

Here are a few standard aspect ratios that you can use for live streaming and other video creation:

![aspect ratios](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-5-aspect-ratio-calculator-online-2.jpg)

**16:9**

A 16:9 aspect ratio represents a wide rectangle. It is also called "1.71:1," the most accessible form of the ratio, mathematically speaking.

This ratio is mainly used in video creation and streaming and is considered the international standard format for cinema and television.

Many also tend to use this highly famous aspect ratio on their sites.

It is also more cost-effective to use screens compatible with this ratio instead of their predecessors. The standardization of computer monitors and televisions saved producers both the money and time spent in the research field.

One of the ideal resolutions you can use with a 16:9 aspect ratio is 4Kor 3840 pixels by 2160 pixels.

**1:1**

The 1:1 video aspect ratio is one of the ideal squares used with square television sets.

It is much less in demand but usually visible on social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram.

Many cameras still have a square setting even though it's not the most commonly used aspect ratio.

**4:3**

The 4:3 aspect ratio was the general screen size for computer monitors and televisions before 16:9 and 16:10\. The reason for the switch was the HDTV birth. It's because the 16:9 and 16:10 aspect ratios allow for better resolutions than 4:3 do.

This aspect ratio was still considered for Apple iPads until they released the 2018 iPad Pro.

**3:2**

The 3:2 aspect ratio was primarily seen in classic 35 mm still photography still used on tablets, laptops, and various game consoles in the handheld form.

Many micro- to medium-sized cameras still use the 3:2 aspect ratio settings, but broadcasters rarely use it today.

**21:9**

The 21:9 aspect ratios have a pretty specific purpose. It is often called cinematic widescreen or ultra-widescreen.

It is also helpful for films with an anamorphic format. Anamorphic format videos create an optical illusion that offers a 360-degree view.

You are likely to look for the videos with this aspect ratio in notable museums, theme parks, theaters, and the like.

**9:16**

A 9:16 aspect ratio is for tall videos. This aspect ratio became famous after the launch of smartphones with video capabilities.

For instance, the optimal measure for an Instagram story is 1080 px by 1920 px, and thus its ratio comes out as 9:16\. The same goes for other famous apps with "story" features, including Snapchat and Facebook.

This makes sense because the iPhone camera's video setting can record footage in both 16:9 and 9:16.

## Part 2 How Do I Know the Aspect Ratio of My Video?

![aspect ratios](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-5-aspect-ratio-calculator-online-3.jpg)

Most cameras with video capabilities are available with various aspect ratio settings. This helps you decide which aspect ratio you'd like your video to have before recording it.

If you are looking to determine the aspect ratio of a video already shot, you can easily access additional information for the file.

The information button is a small "i" in a circle on Mac. Move on to right-click a file and select "**Properties**" on your PC.

It may give you the actual width and height of the video, but you can divide the two to find the aspect ratio.

However, you don't need to hassle as we'll enlist the best five **aspect ratio** **calculators online** below.

It is also helpful for films with an anamorphic format. Anamorphic format videos create an optical illusion that offers a 360-degree view.

You are likely to look for the videos with this aspect ratio in notable museums, theme parks, theaters, and the like.

**9:16**

A 9:16 aspect ratio is for tall videos. This aspect ratio became famous after the launch of smartphones with video capabilities.

For instance, the optimal measure for an Instagram story is 1080 px by 1920 px, and thus its ratio comes out as 9:16\. The same goes for other famous apps with "story" features, including Snapchat and Facebook.

This makes sense because the iPhone camera's video setting can record footage in both 16:9 and 9:16.
