## Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?

Did you know that there are six aspect ratios in total for videos and photos that marketers and creators use? These aspect ratios are 9:16, 16:9, 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 21:9\. The first way to choose the right aspect ratio for your video is whether the video needs to be vertical or horizontal.

A video that's portrait or vertical mode is taller than it is wide. The entire screen is devoted to vertical video capturing while gaining attention.

Smartphones are to be held vertically, and although you can view media always horizontally, it's far simpler for watchers to consume media while keeping their mobile phones upright.

Vertical videos are available in different sizes, but the most standard instances come in the 9:16 aspect ratio. While the traditional format of watching videos on phones has been horizontal with an aspect ratio of 16:9, vertical videos are taller than more comprehensive, hence the reversed aspect ratio. And, this is the main reason you see vertical videos in the frame, and thus, they need to be fixed or rightly shot in terms of ideal **phone aspect ratio vertical**.

## Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens

The aspect ratio also measures how tall or wide a display is. Still, it shouldn't be mistaken for 'display/screen size' calculated by diagonally measuring throughout the screen.

The **phone aspect ratio vertical** is commonly written in proportions with the more petite figure on the right side and the more prominent figure on the left-hand side. It's also sometimes called a decimal, the more prominent figure divided by, the more petite figure.

It means that a display aspect ratio of 16:9 can also be called an aspect ratio of 1.78, i.e., 16/9.

**Types of Aspect ratio**

**●**   **16:9 Aspect Ratio**

16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios used on smartphones. Sometimes showcased as 1.78 or 4²:3², the aspect ratio has become typical for smartphones and other devices since 2010.

It generally means there will be 16 pixels in one direction for every 9 pixels in the other for a device with a 16:9 display.

![16:9 aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone2.jpg)

Devices with a 16:9 aspect ratio are usually broad, and they became the standard aspect ratio for smartphones because most contents are also available in the exact format. So you would enjoy videos and gaming in full widescreen quality on a 16:9 aspect ratio device.

On the other hand, you'll experience the "**Letterboxing effect**" on devices that aren't available in 16:9 aspect ratios and where black bars/bands appear at the bottom and the top of the content you are wandering.

![letterbox image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone3.jpg)

**●**   **18:9 Aspect ratio**

This 18:9 aspect ratio was born out of the need to maximize the size of displays without increasing the dimensions of phone sizes.

The narrow design of 18:9 aspect ratio devices assisted for better one-hand grip, smooth multitasking, enhanced usability, and more screen real estate, etc. Yet, because contents are highly present in the 16:9 aspect ratio, there will be "black bands" at the top, bottom or to your display's right or left.

![18:9 aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone4.jpg)

The 18:9 aspect ratio allows for convenient usage of smartphones, provided we put the content-cropping and letterboxing aside.

**●**   **19:9 Aspect ratio**

19:9 is another smartphone aspect ratio that is becoming increasingly famous and used by top OEMs like Samsung, Huawei, ASUS, and Apple on their flagship devices.

The smartphones with a 19:9 aspect ratio are available with increased height and 19 pixels in single direction for every 9 pixels in the other. Similar to 18:9, devices with a 19:9 aspect ratio generally have pretty non-existent and slimmer bezels, but you'll enjoy vast screen real estate with the latter.

**Understanding iPhone Vertical Video Dimensions**

Apple boasts a 16:9 screen for the versions of iPhone 5 onwards. Most Google/Android phones already had a 16:9 screen at that point. Thus, to export a vertical video, you would want it to be 9:16\. (16:9 standing up!) and it's the ideal size for **iPhone vertical video dimensions**.

The highest quality vertical video's output is 720 Horizontal by 1280 vertical for 1080p (1080X1920).

The highest quality vertical video's output is 576 horizontal by 1024 vertical for 720p (720X1280).

**Vertical Phone Aspect Ratio for Video**

Let's now understand the **mobile vertical video size**! Vertical video is pretty higher than it is wide. Instead of being shown in a landscape orientation or widescreen format, the way video has traditionally intended for television and cinema and television, and the vertical video rotated by 90 degrees.

![video aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone5.jpg)

Hold your phone upright and record video in a 9:16 aspect ratio. Hence, the name vertical video is said to be!

It's because if you horizontally hold your phone, the viewable screen area is 16:9 aspect ratio. The same standard is for most HDTV, video production, and cinema screen sizes.

While watching a video, jerking camera movements are almost always disturbing and distracting. This must be avoided quickly from side to side when creating vertical videos with minimized space on sides.

A video that's portrait or vertical mode is taller than it is wide. The entire screen is devoted to vertical video capturing while gaining attention.

Smartphones are to be held vertically, and although you can view media always horizontally, it's far simpler for watchers to consume media while keeping their mobile phones upright.

Vertical videos are available in different sizes, but the most standard instances come in the 9:16 aspect ratio. While the traditional format of watching videos on phones has been horizontal with an aspect ratio of 16:9, vertical videos are taller than more comprehensive, hence the reversed aspect ratio. And, this is the main reason you see vertical videos in the frame, and thus, they need to be fixed or rightly shot in terms of ideal **phone aspect ratio vertical**.

The aspect ratio also measures how tall or wide a display is. Still, it shouldn't be mistaken for 'display/screen size' calculated by diagonally measuring throughout the screen.

The **phone aspect ratio vertical** is commonly written in proportions with the more petite figure on the right side and the more prominent figure on the left-hand side. It's also sometimes called a decimal, the more prominent figure divided by, the more petite figure.

It means that a display aspect ratio of 16:9 can also be called an aspect ratio of 1.78, i.e., 16/9.

**Types of Aspect ratio**

16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios used on smartphones. Sometimes showcased as 1.78 or 4²:3², the aspect ratio has become typical for smartphones and other devices since 2010.

Devices with a 16:9 aspect ratio are usually broad, and they became the standard aspect ratio for smartphones because most contents are also available in the exact format. So you would enjoy videos and gaming in full widescreen quality on a 16:9 aspect ratio device.

On the other hand, you'll experience the "**Letterboxing effect**" on devices that aren't available in 16:9 aspect ratios and where black bars/bands appear at the bottom and the top of the content you are wandering.

**●**   **18:9 Aspect ratio**

This 18:9 aspect ratio was born out of the need to maximize the size of displays without increasing the dimensions of phone sizes.

 You can now easily capture screenshots on your PS4 with the inclusion of the new _SHARE_ button on the DualShock 4 controller. This can be done either through the short or long press settings configured for your _SHARE_ button. Kindly follow me through the different options that you have on how you can capture and share your PS4 screenshots; **Option 1: Through the SHARE button** or; **Option 2: On A Separate Platform**.

## Capture screenshots on PS4 with SHARE button

 You can’t miss the _SHARE_ button on the new controller for the latest PS4\. It’s sitting on the left-hand side of the touch pad (as shown in the screenshot below). A short press on _SHARE_ button (by default) will take you into the Share’s interface. In order to capture a screen shot, you’ll need to perform a long press. Alternatively, change your _Share Settings_ to _Easy Screenshots_ where the press works in contrary of the defaulted settings.

# Best Time-Lapse Apps for iPhone and Android Devices

Watching the time pass by in front of our eyes is mesmerizing. The fast forwarded scenes of beautiful sunsets, busy streets and all other types of vistas can be found anywhere from Holywood movies to YouTube videos. You don’t need professional camera equipment if you want to create time-lapse videos you can share on your social media accounts because there are plenty of apps that let you create these types of videos directly from your Smartphones. So, in this article, we are going to introduce you to some of the best time-lapse apps for iPhone and Android devices in 2020.

## Best Time-Lapse Apps for Android and iPhone Devices in 2021

The quality of your time-lapse video doesn’t depend only on the number of tools an app offers, which is why you must do everything in your power to record the footage that doesn’t contain camera shakes or any other common mistakes. With that being said, let’s take a look at the five best time-lapse apps you can find on GooglePlay or on the AppStore.

#### 1. [Microsoft Hyperlapse Mobile](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.hyperlapsemobile&hl=en)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Android 4.4 or later

**Rating:** 4.2

This Android-based application makes the creation of time-lapse videos look easy. You just have to select the speed at which you want to record a video, choose between 720p and 1080p resolutions and hit the record button. The app lets you increase the video’s speed up to 32 times, enabling you to create seamless time-lapses, although the video stabilization feature is only available if you’re recording a video at a normal speed. That is why you must ensure that your phone is perfectly stable while the recording is in progress if you want to create a smooth time-lapse. Microsoft Hyperlapse Mobile lets you share your creations on Instagram, Facebook, and other popular social media networks or save the time-lapse you’ve created to your phone’s SD card.

#### 2. [Slo Mo time lapse vid edit.or](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slo-mo-time-lapse-vid-edit-or/id1198548115?mt=8)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 9.0 or later

**Rating:** 4.1

This is a video editing app that doesn’t offer video recording options. However, if you already have the footage you’d like to turn into a time-lapse video, Slo Mo time lapse vid edit.or may be one of the best options you have. Besides creating slow motion and time-lapse videos, you can also use this app to enhance the colors in the footage you’re editing, crop or trim video clips and add customized text overlays to the videos. The app also features a wide spectrum of filters and allows you to add sound effects or music to the video you’re working on. Keep in mind that you have to make an in-app purchase if you want to remove the watermark from your videos or if you want to export your time-lapse and slow-motion videos in Full HD resolution.

#### 3. [Lapse It Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lapse-it-pro-time-lapse-stop-motion-camera-professional-hd/id536495161?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8)

**Price:** $2.99

**Compatibility:** [Android 2.2 or later](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ui.LapseItPro&hl=en), iOS 11 or later

**Rating:** 4.1 on AppStore, 4.3 on Google Play

The seemingly endless list of options the Lapse It Pro offers makes it a perfect choice for all iPhone and Android users who want to speed up the footage they are recording up to 240 times. The app can be used in both Auto and Manual modes, which means that you can control ISO, Exposure or White Balance values while a recording session is still in progress. In case you don’t want to take photos or record videos with Lapse It Pro, you can import already existing footage into the app and turn it into a stunning time-lapse. The app’s render engine exports UHD 4K videos in remarkably short periods of time, so you can quickly share high-quality videos to any of the popular social media networks.

#### 4. [Hyperlapse from Instagram](https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/hyperlapse-from-instagram/id740146917?mt=8)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS 9.0 or later

**Rating:** 4.4

Making time-lapse videos with this app is so easy that you just have to launch the app, hit the record button and point your iPhone towards the scene you’d like to capture. The best part is that you don’t even need an Instagram account to start using the Hyperlapse from Instagram app. You can increase the video’s speed up to 12 times, and you don’t have to worry about the camera shakes since the app features an automatic stabilization feature that is so powerful that you can shoot all your videos handheld. The time-lapse videos you create with this iOS-based app can be easily saved to your phone’s camera roll or shared to Instagram in only a few taps. The only downside is that Hyperlapse for Instagram doesn’t offer any video editing tools.

#### 5. [Framelapse](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Nishant.Singh.DroidTimelapse&hl=en)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Android 4.0 or later

**Rating**: 3.8

Adjusting the frame interval, enhancing the colors in a time-lapse video or selecting the orientation of the video are just a few among countless video recording options the Framelapse app provides. Furthermore, you can control the exposure and white balance values manually or even use the built-in calculator to find out how long the video recording session is going to last. The app allows you to stop recording automatically by setting the duration of the recording, while you can also choose the preferred bitrate or the resolution of the time-lapse video. The free version of Framelapse contains ads, but you can purchase the Pro version of the app that offers even more powerful time-lapse recording options for just $2.99.

**Conclusion**

You no longer need professional cameras, tripods, and [video editors](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to create seamless time-lapse videos that depict the passage of time at a certain location. Instead, you can just download an iOS or Android-based app that enables you to have complete creative control over the process of capturing time-lapse videos and share them with your friends on social media.

Watching the time pass by in front of our eyes is mesmerizing. The fast forwarded scenes of beautiful sunsets, busy streets and all other types of vistas can be found anywhere from Holywood movies to YouTube videos. You don’t need professional camera equipment if you want to create time-lapse videos you can share on your social media accounts because there are plenty of apps that let you create these types of videos directly from your Smartphones. So, in this article, we are going to introduce you to some of the best time-lapse apps for iPhone and Android devices in 2020.

## Best Time-Lapse Apps for Android and iPhone Devices in 2021

The quality of your time-lapse video doesn’t depend only on the number of tools an app offers, which is why you must do everything in your power to record the footage that doesn’t contain camera shakes or any other common mistakes. With that being said, let’s take a look at the five best time-lapse apps you can find on GooglePlay or on the AppStore.

#### 1. [Microsoft Hyperlapse Mobile](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.hyperlapsemobile&hl=en)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Android 4.4 or later

**Rating:** 4.2

This Android-based application makes the creation of time-lapse videos look easy. You just have to select the speed at which you want to record a video, choose between 720p and 1080p resolutions and hit the record button. The app lets you increase the video’s speed up to 32 times, enabling you to create seamless time-lapses, although the video stabilization feature is only available if you’re recording a video at a normal speed. That is why you must ensure that your phone is perfectly stable while the recording is in progress if you want to create a smooth time-lapse. Microsoft Hyperlapse Mobile lets you share your creations on Instagram, Facebook, and other popular social media networks or save the time-lapse you’ve created to your phone’s SD card.

#### 2. [Slo Mo time lapse vid edit.or](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slo-mo-time-lapse-vid-edit-or/id1198548115?mt=8)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 9.0 or later

**Rating:** 4.1

This is a video editing app that doesn’t offer video recording options. However, if you already have the footage you’d like to turn into a time-lapse video, Slo Mo time lapse vid edit.or may be one of the best options you have. Besides creating slow motion and time-lapse videos, you can also use this app to enhance the colors in the footage you’re editing, crop or trim video clips and add customized text overlays to the videos. The app also features a wide spectrum of filters and allows you to add sound effects or music to the video you’re working on. Keep in mind that you have to make an in-app purchase if you want to remove the watermark from your videos or if you want to export your time-lapse and slow-motion videos in Full HD resolution.

#### 3. [Lapse It Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lapse-it-pro-time-lapse-stop-motion-camera-professional-hd/id536495161?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8)

**Price:** $2.99

**Compatibility:** [Android 2.2 or later](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ui.LapseItPro&hl=en), iOS 11 or later

**Rating:** 4.1 on AppStore, 4.3 on Google Play

The seemingly endless list of options the Lapse It Pro offers makes it a perfect choice for all iPhone and Android users who want to speed up the footage they are recording up to 240 times. The app can be used in both Auto and Manual modes, which means that you can control ISO, Exposure or White Balance values while a recording session is still in progress. In case you don’t want to take photos or record videos with Lapse It Pro, you can import already existing footage into the app and turn it into a stunning time-lapse. The app’s render engine exports UHD 4K videos in remarkably short periods of time, so you can quickly share high-quality videos to any of the popular social media networks.

#### 4. [Hyperlapse from Instagram](https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/hyperlapse-from-instagram/id740146917?mt=8)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS 9.0 or later

**Rating:** 4.4

Making time-lapse videos with this app is so easy that you just have to launch the app, hit the record button and point your iPhone towards the scene you’d like to capture. The best part is that you don’t even need an Instagram account to start using the Hyperlapse from Instagram app. You can increase the video’s speed up to 12 times, and you don’t have to worry about the camera shakes since the app features an automatic stabilization feature that is so powerful that you can shoot all your videos handheld. The time-lapse videos you create with this iOS-based app can be easily saved to your phone’s camera roll or shared to Instagram in only a few taps. The only downside is that Hyperlapse for Instagram doesn’t offer any video editing tools.

#### 5. [Framelapse](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Nishant.Singh.DroidTimelapse&hl=en)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Android 4.0 or later

**Rating**: 3.8

Adjusting the frame interval, enhancing the colors in a time-lapse video or selecting the orientation of the video are just a few among countless video recording options the Framelapse app provides. Furthermore, you can control the exposure and white balance values manually or even use the built-in calculator to find out how long the video recording session is going to last. The app allows you to stop recording automatically by setting the duration of the recording, while you can also choose the preferred bitrate or the resolution of the time-lapse video. The free version of Framelapse contains ads, but you can purchase the Pro version of the app that offers even more powerful time-lapse recording options for just $2.99.
