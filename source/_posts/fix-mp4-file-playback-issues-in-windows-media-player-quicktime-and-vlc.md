### Why You Can't Play MP4 Files?

To solve MP4 won't play problem, you must know what is MP4 format. Put it simply, MP4 is a container format like MKV that includes audio/video codec, images and subtitles, in which the audio or video codec determines how to and what a [MP4 player](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) can play a MP4 file most. For instance, VLC can't play MP4 files containing H.265 codec; Windows Media Player doesn't support MP4 format natively and QuickTime supports MP4 videos encoded with MPEG-4 or H.264 video codec and AAC audio codec only. If your MP4 video encoded with other codec, you will fail to play MP4 on Windows \[10\] or Mac.

## How to Solve MP4 File Won't Play on Windows/Mac (Catalina)?

**★ Windows Media Player Can't Play MP4? \[Solved\]** 

[Windows Media Player can't play MP4 file](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) format natively as it was designed to be only compatible with WMV, AVI, ASF, MPG videos formats and WMA, MP3, WAV, AU, AIFF audio formats. You can now upgrade Windows Media Player to version 12 to play some MP4 files on Windows 10/8/7\. However, Windows Media Player 12 fails to work occasionally. You have to turn to other way to solve MP4 video won't play on WMP (12).

**1\. Download Codec Packs:** You can play MP4 media files in Windows Media Player when you install DirectShow-compatible MPEG-4 decoder packs. DirectShow-compatible MPEG-4 decoder packs include the Ligos LSX-MPEG Player and the EnvivioTV. Of course, there are a bunch of [Windows Media Player codec](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) packs on the Internet that will help WMP (12) play MP4 files. K-Lite and CCCP are the most recommended ones at all times. 

**2\. Convert the MP4 Format:** Another feasible way to solve MP4 file won't play on WMP is to convert MP4 to Windows Media Player supported formats like WMV, AVI, ASF, MPG, WMA, MP3, WAV, AU and AIFF. There are a variety of video converters on the market, among which WinX Video Converter, Any Video Converter, Freemake Video Converter and HandBrake are the Big 4 you can trust.

**★ MP4 Won't Play on QuickTime? \[Solved\]** 

MP4 (MPEG 4) is actually a standard that Apple really pushed with Quicktime 6\. So, naturally, you will be able to use .mp4 just fine on a Mac with QuickTime player. But in reality, QT will only play MP4 files that have been encoded to meet Joint Video Team (JVT) standards. It will not play files encoded using proprietary codecs, files encoded employing hybrid features/settings, or files containing content other than MPEG-4 (part 2/10) video and/or MPEG-4 (AAC) audio. That is to say, MP4 won't play on QuickTime also happens. How to solve?

1\. QuickTime 7 and above can handle MP4 files well. QT 7 Pro is powerful enough to deal with that, but at a certain cost - $29.99\. Moreover, if you want to play MP4 files with QuickTime on Windows 10, you have to [download QuickTime for Windows 10](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) and follow a complicated guide to install it. 

2\. You can go to Softonic or CENT to get QuickTime MP4 codec pack to strengthen your QT as you do to WMP. It is also available for solving MP4 won't play on QuickTime by converting MP4 to QT recognizable formats including MOV, M4V, MP3 and M4A. As it is mentioned above, you can choose a video converter to achieve that.

**★ VLC Can't Play MP4 Video Files? \[Solved\]**

VLC plays most codecs with no codec packs needed: MPEG-2, MPEG-4, MPEG-4 ASP, H.264, DivX 4/5/6, XviD, SV1, 3ivX D4 and H.264/MPEG-4 AVCMKV, AMR, WebM, WMV, MP3, etc. However, MP4 files containing codecs like H.265 and other VLC unsupported audio video codecs cannot be read by VLC. Besides download [VLC codec pack](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) from its official website and converting the MP4 format to solve MP4 won't play on VLC, there is another situation you have to notice.

**VLC Hardware Decoding Limitation:** Though MP4 is a lightweight file format for playing, downloading and streaming, it's still inevitable for MP4 4K (2160X4096) video to contain too many audio video tracks for hardware decoding. You need to disable hardware video decoding in VLC:

Launch VLC -->Tools --> Preferences --> Show All Settings  
 \--> Input / Codecs --> Video Codecs --> FFmpeg  
 \--> Uncheck "Hardware decoding"

Now close VLC and open it again, load your MP4 videos and see if your MP4 won't play problem has been solved or not.
