### Why Some MP4 Players Won't Open MP4 Files Properly?

Despite plenty of free MP4 players out there in the market, some of them won't effectively open files as 5KPlayer does, such as QuickTime Player. You may also find some MP4 players online, embedded into a webpage, rendering such basic functions as downloading online MP4 files or converting DVD to MP4\. Temporarily, they can be helpful without the downloading or installing process, yet chances are that MP4 players online can crack down now and then, here taking Keepvid not working as an example.

A standalone MP4 video player, in this regard, is better able to meet your everyday use, and 5KPlayer is just a case in point.

## Top 3 MP4 Players Windows/Mac to Play MPEG-4 Videos

The first rule of a MP4 player software that you should look at is its codec range, aka how many types of video/audio codecs are integrated into its multimedia kernel. Luckily, 5KPlayer is an all-codec MP4 media player for Mac and Windows 10 which works like a powerhouse bolstering the demuxing of MP4 MKV, FLV, M4V, AVI, etc. videos.

#### **NO 1\. 5KPlayer - All-Codec MP4 Player Free**

This free MP4 video player recognizes video, audio and subtitle files wrapped-up into an MPEG4-part2 or MPEG4-part14 container easily, and it baskets probably the most extensive codec range available, thus having no problem dealing with the MPEG-2, AVI videos therein, let alone some even more popular codecs like MPEG4-part 2/10, MPEG1-part2, MPEG2-part2, H.264 and H.265 that are state-of-the-art, and GPU-demanding as well.

With 5KPlayer at hand, you no longer need to worry if the previous MP4 video player run into such problems as the user below does: It is able to render a video yet MP4 no picture, chances are that it's incompatible with the latest codecs like H.265, H.264, which are often used in HD, 4K videos.

_**"**I have a .mp4 video and in MPC it only plays the sound but with no picture... I tried installing Haali but then it came back with something about pins not aligned or something missing?_ 

_What do I need to do? I have read about ffdshow codec for a MP4 player but will this cause conflicts, or is there an easier way?**"**_

Indeed, tediously installing codec packs can finally take you to successfully play the MP4 videos you wish to, possibly with hours of work. That being said, if you'd prefer an easier way out - try 5KPlayer, an intuitive **[free MP4 player](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/)** to directly download below ↓↓↓

#### **NO 2\. DivX 10 - Multi-Platform HD-Quality MP4 Video Player**

The pursuit for higher resolutions never ends and DivX Player 10 is a nice option to play them all.

 To be brief, a MP4 player is capable of playing HD MP4 videos as long as it's configured with a proper built-in decoder (or backed-up by a MP4 codec pack). Despite the fact that MP4 is the most extensively used online video format featuring high compression rate with low quality loss, a 4K (4320\*2160p) video still places great demand on both the MP4 video player and the CPU of the computer. Hence without a well-written H.265 decoder, your favorite free MP4 player won't go well with 4K videos encoded with H.265\. 

![DivX video player](https://www.5kplayer.com/video-music-player/img/divx-windows7.jpg) 

Just like 5KPlayer, DivX Player 10 is a competitive 4K video player which is designated to play 4K MP4 (H.264, H.265, VP8 and VP8) thanks to its resilient response to the most cutting edge multimedia standard. You can rest assured with this free MP4 player, or download it in its latest version for Windows 10 and Mac. Now that in every MP4 player, a decoder for an encoded video, and the wider the codec range is, the more universal this player will be. The feature-rich kernel guarantees DivX Player 10 to be very trustworthy for MP4 playback.

Another thing to look for from a MP4 player is its capability for bitrate, the second decisive factor for the image quality of a MP4 file. If you give MP4 video files to 5KPlayer and another MP4 player, the performance remains stable even when the total bitrate rises to 2Mbps in 5KPlayer, while the latter is highly likely to stutter with videos in 1970kbps, 1080p or lower. 

#### **NO 3\. Windows Media Player 12 - Clean, Compact MP4 Player**

Another free MP4 video player that can play MP4 on Windows 10\. Probably the only problem is that Windows 10 doesn't have native support for all MP4 files and Windows Media Player doesn't come with necessary video codecs either, therefore, sometimes it relies on external video codecs to play MP4 video on Windows 10\. 

Besides MP4 playback, Windows Media Player 12 works on Windows 10 seamlessly to burn DVD. Some other excellent MP4 player can work perfectly on previous Windows version (Windows 8.1/Windows 7) but have glitches when playing MP4 on Windows 10, such as Media Player Classic for Windows 10, always stop and sometimes not responding on Window 10\.

### Summary: What Makes 5KPlayer A Better MP4 Player Than the Rest?

![](https://www.5kplayer.com/video-music-player/../seoimg/ic1.png) 5KPlayer is a standalone free MP4 player, it doesn't need any video codec installed to help playing MP4 video on Mac and Windows.
