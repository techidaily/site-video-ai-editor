# Top 15 Adobe Premiere Plugins for Effects and Transitions

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg)

##### Benjamin Arango

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Although Premiere is a complete and robust platform, there is always room for customization, extras, and just plain cool add-ons that are too niche for Adobe to produce themselves.

For example, you can add [free Adobe Premiere title templates](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to make your video excellent.

While everyone's list will be different depending on what they use Premiere for, here is my choice of tools and effects that I find the most useful.

* [**Part 1: Top 15 Adobe Premiere Pro Plugins for Transitions and Effects**](#part1)
* [**Part 2: FAQ about Adobe Premiere Plugins**](#part2)

## Best Alternative to Adobe Premiere - Filmora

The Premiere is excellent if you can find the best Adobe Premiere plugin at the time and money price.

If you want to edit videos easily, here we recommend using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). It is designed for pros who want to make video easily or want to enter a professional video editing level.

For transitions, it has various built-in creative tools to use, including dissolve, motion, zoom, and more. For effects, you can use cinematic effects without efforts.

Unlimited tracks can power up your story with various videos and audio. Free download it to have a try!

Before choosing a plugin, you should consider [compatibility](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/compatibility.html) and [extensibility](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/extensibility.html) in case the plugin is not working with Premiere. You can also visit the Adobe [partner finder database](https://www.adobe.com/partners.html) to have a closer relationship with developers around the world if you want to search for plugin partners

## Part 1: Top 15 Adobe Premiere Pro Plugins for Transitions and Effects

#### 1[After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html)

Some may say this is cheating, but for me, this is the number one add-on for Premiere. There is a reason for this, and that is that After Effects enables you to create anything you can dream of wanting within the Premiere environment.

Graphics, transitions, titles and templates, composites and a myriad of other options can be created and imported directly into Premiere. They integrate perfectly and enable smooth transitions between a Premiere project, creating an effect or graphic in After Effects.

Other plugins appear in this list that are extremely capable of a specific scenario, but none of the breadth of ability that After Effects brings to the table.

It is the best Adobe Premiere plugins to download.

**Price**: $20.99/month

**Features**

* **Steep learning**: we have to admit that it is not easy to make Adobe Premiere plugins with Effects, but if you have learned how-to, you are the master.
* **Animation**: If you like animation style video, you can use it to make Adobe Premiere animation plugins.

![After Effects adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-1.png)

#### 2[Neat Video](https://www.neatvideo.com/index.html?linkID=p7334)

Neat Video is a great plugin for Premiere, unlike After Effects it has a single function, and that is noise reduction. It is very good at it.

While Camera technology has advanced at a remarkable rate, there are still circumstances when even the best cameras available to us produce a video that is a little too noisy for its intended use, and this is where Neat Video steps in.

It works as a video filter from within the Premiere environment. It can be applied to a sequence in its entirety of any number of individual clips within the sequence as desired.

Although aimed at noise reduction for modern digital cameras, Neat Video is also very useful in the digitization process of older VHS or film stock. It can be used to clean up the resulting digital file.

**Price**: $74.9/month

**Features**

* **Underwater shots**: You can make underwater shots with this plug-in. With it, you can make your video more beautiful.
* **Accurate and efficient**: As the best Adobe Premiere plugin, it can offer you an accurate effect.

![free download Neat Video adobe plugins](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-2.png)

#### 3[Final Effects](http://www.borisfx.com/Adobe/fecae/)

A utility box of effects and transitions if ever there was one, Final Effects integrates smoothly with Premiere and includes over 120 different items. If you want to broaden your effects library but do not have any specific requirements, then this is the product for you. I particularly like the 3D relief effect, but there is something in here for every type of project you can think.

**Price**: $2495 for all bundles

**Features**

* **Stylized looks**: it offers various filters to use
* **Auto-animating transitions**: you can make animation style transitions auto.

![Final Effects adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-3.png)

#### 4[Magic Bullet Looks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TG2IG36/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00TG2IG36&linkId=40a4862dea2acf5507b237e385f8d55e)

This is a wondrous plugin that is primarily a color finishing tool but includes a raft of options that make it much more useful. The color finishing is first class. It comes with over 100 included presets organized by category so you can quickly find the right one for your project, plus the ability to fine-tune and save the results as custom presets meaning the possibilities are endless to obtain the right unified look you wish for your project.

In addition, options for lens distortion and lighting enable either corrections or stylized looks to be implemented to complement the color choices made.

**Price**: $899

**Features**

* **Great compatibility**: it works well on Windows and Mac.
* **Price**: the price may be higher than we thought.

![download Magic Bullet Looks adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-4.png)

#### 5[Flicker Free](http://digitalanarchy.com/Flicker/main.html)

This one is quite a specific plugin that won't be for everyone, but if you are a regular proponent of time-lapse or slow-motion footage, this is a plugin that will be your best friend for life. One of the time-lapse issues is the changing exposures during such filming that produce a flickering effect when viewed.

What flicker-free does is to normalize the exposure and remove the flicker. It not only works on time-lapse, but can solve similar issues with slow-motion filming, and even assist with the rolling effect you can get from LED lighting and computer monitors.

It works from within Premiere and comes with useful presets to make the process as simple as possible. However, they can all be individually tweaked where necessary to get the perfect results.

**Price**: $79/$99.

**Features**

* **Fluent workflow**: the working experience is great if you try it.
* Time-lapse: You can make the time-lapse or slow-motion video better by specific Premiere plugin.

![free download Flicker adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-5.png)

#### 6[Damage](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N1JPCEW/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01N1JPCEW&linkId=01542ff77ba269b302237cf03a190f81)

Another great plugin that is very specific in its use, Damage is, despite the name, a non-destructive filter plugin that simulates the grain, glitches, scan lines, and grit of aged film stock. There are over 80 presets available to use, and whilst its use is not going to be hugely widespread, for producing that aged effect there is nothing better.

**Price**: $299

**Features**

* 5 tool kits: it includes 5 Adobe Premiere plug-ins

![Damage adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-6.png)

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win-pro.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac-pro.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 7[Rays](http://www.digitalfilmtools.com/rays/)

This is a nice plugin that allows the creation of, you've guessed it, Rays. That is light rays to be precise. Atmospheric, beautiful, they can be many things, but there is no questioning the effectiveness of this plugin at simulating light rays. It's outstanding, as this promotional image shows.

**Features**

#### 8 [Coremelt](http://www.coremelt.com/products/coremelt-complete-v2.html)

Another 'box of tricks' style product, Coremelt includes a huge number over 220 of effects and transitions.

It's the sheer breadth of options within the package that makes this one a must for any aspiring video editor.

This is a professional grade package of effects and transitions that raises the bar for what is possible. My favorite one is the tilt-shift that produces that toy-like landscape that has become popular within the photography world in recent years.

There are over 600 effects within the Vitascene package. It is not the cheapest out there by any means, but is aimed squarely at the professional output and has the quality to do it.

Some may say this is cheating, but for me, this is the number one add-on for Premiere. There is a reason for this, and that is that After Effects enables you to create anything you can dream of wanting within the Premiere environment.

Graphics, transitions, titles and templates, composites and a myriad of other options can be created and imported directly into Premiere. They integrate perfectly and enable smooth transitions between a Premiere project, creating an effect or graphic in After Effects.

Other plugins appear in this list that are extremely capable of a specific scenario, but none of the breadth of ability that After Effects brings to the table.

It is the best Adobe Premiere plugins to download.

**Price**: $20.99/month

**Features**

* **Steep learning**: we have to admit that it is not easy to make Adobe Premiere plugins with Effects, but if you have learned how-to, you are the master.
* **Animation**: If you like animation style video, you can use it to make Adobe Premiere animation plugins.

#### 2[Neat Video](https://www.neatvideo.com/index.html?linkID=p7334)

Neat Video is a great plugin for Premiere, unlike After Effects it has a single function, and that is noise reduction. It is very good at it.

While Camera technology has advanced at a remarkable rate, there are still circumstances when even the best cameras available to us produce a video that is a little too noisy for its intended use, and this is where Neat Video steps in.

It works as a video filter from within the Premiere environment. It can be applied to a sequence in its entirety of any number of individual clips within the sequence as desired.

Although aimed at noise reduction for modern digital cameras, Neat Video is also very useful in the digitization process of older VHS or film stock. It can be used to clean up the resulting digital file.

**Price**: $74.9/month

**Features**

* **Underwater shots**: You can make underwater shots with this plug-in. With it, you can make your video more beautiful.
* **Accurate and efficient**: As the best Adobe Premiere plugin, it can offer you an accurate effect.

![free download Neat Video adobe plugins](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-2.png)

#### 3[Final Effects](http://www.borisfx.com/Adobe/fecae/)

A utility box of effects and transitions if ever there was one, Final Effects integrates smoothly with Premiere and includes over 120 different items. If you want to broaden your effects library but do not have any specific requirements, then this is the product for you. I particularly like the 3D relief effect, but there is something in here for every type of project you can think.

**Price**: $2495 for all bundles

**Features**

* **Stylized looks**: it offers various filters to use
* **Auto-animating transitions**: you can make animation style transitions auto.

![Final Effects adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-3.png)

#### 4[Magic Bullet Looks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TG2IG36/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00TG2IG36&linkId=40a4862dea2acf5507b237e385f8d55e)

This is a wondrous plugin that is primarily a color finishing tool but includes a raft of options that make it much more useful. The color finishing is first class. It comes with over 100 included presets organized by category so you can quickly find the right one for your project, plus the ability to fine-tune and save the results as custom presets meaning the possibilities are endless to obtain the right unified look you wish for your project.

In addition, options for lens distortion and lighting enable either corrections or stylized looks to be implemented to complement the color choices made.

**Price**: $899

**Features**

* **Great compatibility**: it works well on Windows and Mac.
* **Price**: the price may be higher than we thought.

![download Magic Bullet Looks adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-4.png)

#### 5[Flicker Free](http://digitalanarchy.com/Flicker/main.html)

This one is quite a specific plugin that won't be for everyone, but if you are a regular proponent of time-lapse or slow-motion footage, this is a plugin that will be your best friend for life. One of the time-lapse issues is the changing exposures during such filming that produce a flickering effect when viewed.

What flicker-free does is to normalize the exposure and remove the flicker. It not only works on time-lapse, but can solve similar issues with slow-motion filming, and even assist with the rolling effect you can get from LED lighting and computer monitors.

It works from within Premiere and comes with useful presets to make the process as simple as possible. However, they can all be individually tweaked where necessary to get the perfect results.

**Price**: $79/$99.

**Features**

* **Fluent workflow**: the working experience is great if you try it.
* Time-lapse: You can make the time-lapse or slow-motion video better by specific Premiere plugin.

![free download Flicker adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-5.png)

Another great plugin that is very specific in its use, Damage is, despite the name, a non-destructive filter plugin that simulates the grain, glitches, scan lines, and grit of aged film stock. There are over 80 presets available to use, and whilst its use is not going to be hugely widespread, for producing that aged effect there is nothing better.

**Price**: $299

**Features**

![Damage adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-6.png)

#### 7[Rays](http://www.digitalfilmtools.com/rays/)

Although Premiere is a complete and robust platform, there is always room for customization, extras, and just plain cool add-ons that are too niche for Adobe to produce themselves.

For example, you can add [free Adobe Premiere title templates](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to make your video excellent.

While everyone's list will be different depending on what they use Premiere for, here is my choice of tools and effects that I find the most useful.

* [**Part 2: FAQ about Adobe Premiere Plugins**](#part2)

If you want to edit videos easily, here we recommend using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). It is designed for pros who want to make video easily or want to enter a professional video editing level.

Before choosing a plugin, you should consider [compatibility](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/compatibility.html) and [extensibility](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/extensibility.html) in case the plugin is not working with Premiere.

## Part 1: Top 15 Adobe Premiere Pro Plugins for Transitions and Effects

#### 1[After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html)

Some may say this is cheating, but for me, this is the number one add-on for Premiere. There is a reason for this, and that is that After Effects enables you to create anything you can dream of wanting within the Premiere environment.

Graphics, transitions, titles and templates, composites and a myriad of other options can be created and imported directly into Premiere. They integrate perfectly and enable smooth transitions between a Premiere project, creating an effect or graphic in After Effects.

Other plugins appear in this list that are extremely capable of a specific scenario, but none of the breadth of ability that After Effects brings to the table.

It is the best Adobe Premiere plugins to download.

**Price**: $20.99/month

**Features**

* **Steep learning**: we have to admit that it is not easy to make Adobe Premiere plugins with Effects, but if you have learned how-to, you are the master.
* **Animation**: If you like animation style video, you can use it to make Adobe Premiere animation plugins.

![After Effects adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-1.png)

#### 2[Neat Video](https://www.neatvideo.com/index.html?linkID=p7334)

Neat Video is a great plugin for Premiere, unlike After Effects it has a single function, and that is noise reduction. It is very good at it.

While Camera technology has advanced at a remarkable rate, there are still circumstances when even the best cameras available to us produce a video that is a little too noisy for its intended use, and this is where Neat Video steps in.

It works as a video filter from within the Premiere environment. It can be applied to a sequence in its entirety of any number of individual clips within the sequence as desired.

Although aimed at noise reduction for modern digital cameras, Neat Video is also very useful in the digitization process of older VHS or film stock. It can be used to clean up the resulting digital file.

**Price**: $74.9/month

**Features**

* **Underwater shots**: You can make underwater shots with this plug-in. With it, you can make your video more beautiful.
* **Accurate and efficient**: As the best Adobe Premiere plugin, it can offer you an accurate effect.

![free download Neat Video adobe plugins](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-2.png)

#### 3[Final Effects](http://www.borisfx.com/Adobe/fecae/)

A utility box of effects and transitions if ever there was one, Final Effects integrates smoothly with Premiere and includes over 120 different items. If you want to broaden your effects library but do not have any specific requirements, then this is the product for you. I particularly like the 3D relief effect, but there is something in here for every type of project you can think.

**Price**: $2495 for all bundles

**Features**

* **Stylized looks**: it offers various filters to use
* **Auto-animating transitions**: you can make animation style transitions auto.

![Final Effects adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-3.png)

#### 4[Magic Bullet Looks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TG2IG36/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00TG2IG36&linkId=40a4862dea2acf5507b237e385f8d55e)

This is a wondrous plugin that is primarily a color finishing tool but includes a raft of options that make it much more useful. The color finishing is first class. It comes with over 100 included presets organized by category so you can quickly find the right one for your project, plus the ability to fine-tune and save the results as custom presets meaning the possibilities are endless to obtain the right unified look you wish for your project.

In addition, options for lens distortion and lighting enable either corrections or stylized looks to be implemented to complement the color choices made.

**Price**: $899

**Features**

* **Great compatibility**: it works well on Windows and Mac.
* **Price**: the price may be higher than we thought.

![download Magic Bullet Looks adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-4.png)

#### 5[Flicker Free](http://digitalanarchy.com/Flicker/main.html)

This one is quite a specific plugin that won't be for everyone, but if you are a regular proponent of time-lapse or slow-motion footage, this is a plugin that will be your best friend for life. One of the time-lapse issues is the changing exposures during such filming that produce a flickering effect when viewed.

What flicker-free does is to normalize the exposure and remove the flicker. It not only works on time-lapse, but can solve similar issues with slow-motion filming, and even assist with the rolling effect you can get from LED lighting and computer monitors.

It works from within Premiere and comes with useful presets to make the process as simple as possible. However, they can all be individually tweaked where necessary to get the perfect results.

**Price**: $79/$99.

**Features**

* **Fluent workflow**: the working experience is great if you try it.
* Time-lapse: You can make the time-lapse or slow-motion video better by specific Premiere plugin.

![free download Flicker adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-5.png)

#### 6[Damage](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N1JPCEW/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01N1JPCEW&linkId=01542ff77ba269b302237cf03a190f81)

Another great plugin that is very specific in its use, Damage is, despite the name, a non-destructive filter plugin that simulates the grain, glitches, scan lines, and grit of aged film stock. There are over 80 presets available to use, and whilst its use is not going to be hugely widespread, for producing that aged effect there is nothing better.

**Price**: $299

**Features**

* 5 tool kits: it includes 5 Adobe Premiere plug-ins

![Damage adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-6.png)

#### 7[Rays](http://www.digitalfilmtools.com/rays/)

This is a professional grade package of effects and transitions that raises the bar for what is possible. My favorite one is the tilt-shift that produces that toy-like landscape that has become popular within the photography world in recent years.

There are over 600 effects within the Vitascene package. It is not the cheapest out there by any means, but is aimed squarely at the professional output and has the quality to do it.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

 Instagram’s announcement that the stop motion feature will become available in the Stories section created quite a buzz on the Internet, a while ago. In 2020, the feature remains relatively unknown to social media users, even though on paper it seemed promising.

 Stop motion videos, are simply sequentially taken photos that create an illusion of movement once they are played one after the other. These [types of videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are growing more popular on social media, as they can make Instagram stories or any other social media feed more interesting. You are at the right place if you would like to join video content creators who already [produce stop motion videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) because in this article we are going to show you how to make a stop motion video on Instagram.

## Part 1: How to Make a Stop Motion Video on Instagram?

 The technical side of making a stop motion video on Instagram is rather simple since you can enable this feature in just a few taps. After you launch the app, you should tap on the **Camera** icon in the upper left corner of the screen. The new window will open where you can choose the type of Instagram story you want to create, so you can pick to [go live](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), record a video normally or use the app’s Boomerang feature.

 You will find the Stop Motion option at the end of this menu, and after you tap on it you just have to press the white button in the middle of the toolbar that is located near the bottom of the screen in order to start taking pictures.

 Currently, Instagram limits the number of photos you can take with the stop motion feature to ten. Tap on the Done button that is located at the top of the screen once you completed the process of making a stop motion video and then proceed to choose stickers you would like to include in the story you created. Press the Send To button and decide if you want to share the stop motion video to your Instagram or Facebook story or with some of your Instagram followers. ;

_Check_ _the_ _ultimate guide about [how to use Instagram Stories](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)_

### Cons of Making Stop Motion Videos with Instagram

 Even though Instagram’s new stop motion feature offers an easy way to make your stories more interesting, it still has a few downsides. [Adding sound or music](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to stop motion videos you create with Instagram isn’t possible at the moment, and you can’t do much more other than downloading the video to your device.

 Like all other Instagram stories, stop motion videos created with this app are only available for 24 hours if you don’t save them on your phone. Moreover, [downloading the stories you create with Instagram](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)’s stop motion tool will enable you to edit them with [video editing apps for iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Android devices and post them to any social media platform you choose.

 In addition, the maximum number of frames a stop motion video created with Instagram can have is limited to just ten.

### Frequently Asked Questions: Why Can’t I See the Stop Motion Feature in Instagram Stories?

 Instagram’s stop motion feature is still in its beta stage, which means that it isn’t available on all versions of the app. So, if you can’t see this option you must go to Google Play or Apps Store and install the version of Instagram that has this feature. If the issue persists, you should opt for some other stop motion app you can use free of charge. ;

## Part 2: 3 Best Stop Motion Apps you can Use to Create Animated Videos for Instagram

 You shouldn’t worry if the stop motion feature isn’t available on the version of Instagram you’re using, because there are so many apps that are equipped with this tool. With so many different options on the market, finding the app that provides you with all features you need to create stop motion videos can be a difficult task. That’s why we shortlisted the three best apps for iPhones and Android devices that enable you to make animated stop motion videos for Instagram.

### 1\. [Over](https://www.madewithover.com/)

**Price:** Free, offers in-app purchase

**Compatibility:** iOS, Android

 Over allows you to do much more than just create stop motion videos you can post on Instagram since it is equipped with a versatile set of tools that can help you improve the brand awareness on social media. There are more than 700 [templates](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to choose from and each of them enables you to adjust your photos and videos to the social network’s demands. However, the free version of the app offers only limited capabilities, and you must upgrade to the Pro version if you want to have access to all photo and video editing tools Over have to offer.

### 2\. Mojo

**Price:** Free, offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/mojo-create-video-stories/id1434861974), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=video.mojo)

![create stop motion video for IG in Mojo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mojo-create-video-stories.jpg)

 Creating content for social media with Mojo is a simple process that can be completed in just three easy steps. You don’t even need a Mojo account to start creating stories with this app. All you have to do is select an animated template, import videos or photos and edit it before tapping on the share button. There are more than a hundred animated templates to choose from, so after you pick one, you just have to [add text overlays](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), but you must purchase Mojo Pro if you want to [change aspect ratios](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), duplicate stories or have access to all text styles and templates.

### 3\. [Life Lapse](https://www.lifelapseapp.com/)

**Price:** Free, offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/life-lapse-stop-motion-camera/id1281464378), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lifelapse&hl=en)

![Life Lapse Stop Motion Maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/life-lapse-stop-motion-camera.jpg)

 The fact that more than a million video content creators and brands are using Life Lapse to make stop motion videos says a lot about the app’s capabilities. Unlike Over and Mojo, Life Lapse lets you set the exposure and focus locks, switch on a grid or use the ghosted image overlay. Besides capturing photos and videos, the app also allows you to import photos you want to include in the stop motion animation. Furthermore, even the free version of Life Lapse offers a variety of video editing tools that allow you to crop images or adjust saturation, brightness or white balance values in each frame.

## Part 3: How to Create a Stop Motion Videos with Life Lapse

 You don’t have to be a skilled cinematographer to make a stop motion video using the Life Lapse app. Once you’ve installed and launched Life Lapse you should create a new project by tapping on the + icon. As soon as the camera loads you’ll be asked to choose if you would like to create a photo or a video project. Tap on the photo option and start taking photos of the objects or people you want to include in your stop motion video.

 The app also grants you access to a broad range of tools that will make composing the shots easier or reduce the flickering effect. Even though Life Lapse doesn’t limit the maximum duration of the stop motion videos you can create with it, an Instagram story cannot be longer than 15 seconds. Furthermore, changing a video’s aspect ratio to 9:16 is recommended, as it will enable you to know exactly how your stop motion video is going to look like after you upload it to Instagram.

## Part 4: Tips for Creating Stop Motion Videos for Instagram

 The process of making a stop motion animation is not technically complicated since you just need to place your phone on a [tripod](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and take a photo each time you move an object in the shot. Even so, working on a stop motion project requires previous preparations. Here are a few tips that will help you make a better stop motion animation video.

### 1\. Develop a concept

 What is your stop motion video about? This is the first and the most important question you will have to answer before you start making a stop motion video. Developing a concept will enable you to know which props you are going to need or how many actors you have to find before you can actually start shooting. Stop motion videos can be virtually about anything, and you should choose a story that will keep the audience interested from start to finish.

### 2\. Shoot in studio conditions

 Although it is not impossible to make a stop motion video in outdoor conditions, having control over sudden light changes is. That is why it is much better to shoot stop motion videos in studio-like conditions where you can easily adjust all the parameters in accordance with the demands of the project you’re working on. In addition, it is paramount to keep your phone perfectly steady, which is why it is better to mount it on a tripod than to shoot handheld.

**Conclusion**

 Instagram’s stop motion feature is still under development and it may be some time before you can use it to create professional-looking videos. Apps like Over or Life Lapse are a much better option for all video content creators who would like to impress their audience with stop motion videos. Which app are you using to create stop motion videos? Leave a comment and let us know.

## Part 4: Tips for Creating Stop Motion Videos for Instagram

Even so, working on a stop motion project requires previous preparations. Here are a few tips that will help you make a better stop motion animation video.

### 1\. Develop a concept

 What is your stop motion video about? This is the first and the most important question you will have to answer before you start making a stop motion video. Developing a concept will enable you to know which props you are going to need or how many actors you have to find before you can actually start shooting. Stop motion videos can be virtually about anything, and you should choose a story that will keep the audience interested from start to finish.

### 2\. Shoot in studio conditions

 Although it is not impossible to make a stop motion video in outdoor conditions, having control over sudden light changes is. That is why it is much better to shoot stop motion videos in studio-like conditions where you can easily adjust all the parameters in accordance with the demands of the project you’re working on. In addition, it is paramount to keep your phone perfectly steady, which is why it is better to mount it on a tripod than to shoot handheld.

**Conclusion**

 Instagram’s stop motion feature is still under development and it may be some time before you can use it to create professional-looking videos. Apps like Over or Life Lapse are a much better option for all video content creators who would like to impress their audience with stop motion videos.
