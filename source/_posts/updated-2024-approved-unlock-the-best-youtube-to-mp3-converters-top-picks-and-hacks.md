## Part 3: What are the limitations when using Sony Vegas (Vegas Pro) on Mac?

Yes, with the given **Sony Vegas alternatives, Mac** and Windows users can benefit heavily. But why is it important to try for a replacement when Sony Vegas Pro is relatively efficient software?

To know the answer, you should take the time to understand its limitations, which do exist.

#### **It only works for Windows users**

The Sony Vegas Pro software is not available for Mac or other operating systems besides Windows. In addition, it’ll be really complex and time-consuming, even if you opt for virtual machine software or handle dual booting techniques to configure the software on your Mac or Linux.

#### **You need to invest in other hardware**

Sony Vegas Pro does do not work within one comprehensive platform like other capable video editing software types, like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You have to acquire a powerful PC and tools to operate it separately. The software works very slowly on older devices.

#### **Not incredibly unique**

The functions of Sony Vegas Pro match somewhat with other options in the market. So, users would not expect much value in purchasing this software’s plans that they want to upgrade from their previous system, but on the other hand, the available features are mostly standard-level in functionality as well.

## Hot FAQs about Vegas Pro Alternatives

After knowing these details, many users still have specific common queries about opting for a Sony Vegas Pro alternatively. So these are some common FAQs about this- answered.

#### 1\. Can Sony Vegas be used on a Mac?

No, it is impossible to directly use Sony Vegas on macOS devices since it does not support it. Instead, you have to separately use a dual boot strategy or virtual machine software to activate the video editor on Mac devices, but the process for that is complex.

#### 2\. Is Wondershare Filmora or Vegas Pro better?

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Vegas Pro are top-level options in video and audio editing projects with professional-level editing accuracy. However, Filmora has a cohesive ecosystem with rich AI and standard functions and comes with Mac/Windows support. So, in that sense, Filmora is comparatively a better choice.

## Final Words

Out of them, [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is one that we will recommend due to its multi-faceted benefits and features for Mac and Windows users.

## Part 3: What are the limitations when using Sony Vegas (Vegas Pro) on Mac?

Yes, with the given **Sony Vegas alternatives, Mac** and Windows users can benefit heavily. But why is it important to try for a replacement when Sony Vegas Pro is relatively efficient software?

To know the answer, you should take the time to understand its limitations, which do exist.

#### **It only works for Windows users**

The Sony Vegas Pro software is not available for Mac or other operating systems besides Windows. In addition, it’ll be really complex and time-consuming, even if you opt for virtual machine software or handle dual booting techniques to configure the software on your Mac or Linux.

#### **You need to invest in other hardware**

Sony Vegas Pro does do not work within one comprehensive platform like other capable video editing software types, like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You have to acquire a powerful PC and tools to operate it separately. The software works very slowly on older devices.

#### **Not incredibly unique**

The functions of Sony Vegas Pro match somewhat with other options in the market. So, users would not expect much value in purchasing this software’s plans that they want to upgrade from their previous system, but on the other hand, the available features are mostly standard-level in functionality as well.

## Hot FAQs about Vegas Pro Alternatives

After knowing these details, many users still have specific common queries about opting for a Sony Vegas Pro alternatively. So these are some common FAQs about this- answered.

#### 1\. Can Sony Vegas be used on a Mac?

No, it is impossible to directly use Sony Vegas on macOS devices since it does not support it. Instead, you have to separately use a dual boot strategy or virtual machine software to activate the video editor on Mac devices, but the process for that is complex.

#### 2\. Is Wondershare Filmora or Vegas Pro better?

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Vegas Pro are top-level options in video and audio editing projects with professional-level editing accuracy. However, Filmora has a cohesive ecosystem with rich AI and standard functions and comes with Mac/Windows support. So, in that sense, Filmora is comparatively a better choice.

## Final Words

In place of Sony Vegas Pro, any of these options would also give you a great user experience. Out of them, [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is one that we will recommend due to its multi-faceted benefits and features for Mac and Windows users. Ultimately, make your decision based on your particular needs.
