![MOV Player](https://www.5kplayer.com/video-music-player/img/free-mov-5kplayer.jpg) 

**No.1 5KPlayer – Free MOV Video Player for Mac & Windows** 

Supporting all video music including MOV M4V MP4 M4A MP3 H.264 in QuickTime format and WMV WMA ASF in Windows media format, 5KPlayer can be the best free MOV file player for both iMac/MacBook/MacBook Air/MacBook Pro powered by macOS Mojave (or earlier) and Surface Pro 4/Dell XPS 13/Samsung Galaxy TabPro S/HP Spectre x360 13 shipped with windows 10/8/7.  
  
 Containing 180 audio and 450 video codecs or even more which QuickTime or Windows Media Player won't play, this mov player will keep you away from QuickTime or [Windows Media Player can't play MOV](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) MP4 WMV MKV AVI FLV WMA etc problem or the dreaded "Windows can't open this file" error message. 

Unlike 5KPlayer, most other MOV video players require you to install third party software or codecs like downloading MOV MKV codec to enable support for the particular type of file you wish to play. 5KPlayer simplifies that by comprising all common and some rare video audio codecs to achieve multi media playback. Not so with 5KPlayer – this MOV file player includes everything you need.

QuickTime Player is the default MOV file player built in MacBook/MacBook Air/MacBook Pro/iMac powered by Mac OS, and designed for specific file formats like MOV M4V MP4 M4A and MP3\. Namely, QuickTime for Windows 10/8/7 is not very confugurable and QuickTime won't play MP4 problem happens now and then. It's indeed the inherent [MOV player for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/), but QuickTime Player is not so satisfactory to play all MOV files as only MOV file encoded with MPEG-4 or H.264 video and AAC audio is supported by QuickTime. Inferior to 5KPlayer, MP4 MKV AVI won't play on Mac happens often unless you download the specific codec, converting the file format or intall the plug-in on QuickTime.

**Pros:**  
**1\.** Edit the MOV files directly.  
**2\.** Good graphics to watch the films and movies, also its simple to use.

Like 5KPlayer, this MOV file player supports various languages, audio tracks and DVD playback, and allows you to add subtitiles, rewind/fast-forward the MOV video, manage your downloads, etc at will. 

**Pros:**  
**1\.** Supports MOV files with H.264/AAC codec.  
**2\.** Offers Blu-ray disc experience on computer with advanced DivX Plus/MKV features.

### What is .MOV and How to Play?

MOV format is a QuickTime media container format, developed by Apple Computer Inc. It is natively supported by such MOV file players as QuickTime Player. Yet despite all that, some MOV files cannot be played in QuickTime Player casually. MOV is a multimedia container format that can include one or more tracks, each of which stores a particular type of data: audio, video, effects, or text (e.g. for subtitles). Thus, MOV players such as QuickTime may have trouble to process all MOV files successfully.

Compared with Mac users, Windows users make MOV playing much harder. MOV isn't accepted by Windows Media Player, except for Windows Media Player 12\. If you believe that you only need to download Windows Media Player 12 for MOV playback on Windows, you are totally wrong. This is because Windows Media Player 12 is only available for Windows 7 and later. If you are working on older versions like Windows Vista, you are highly recommended to try another MOV video player like 5KPlayer.
