![MOV Player](https://www.5kplayer.com/video-music-player/img/free-mov-5kplayer.jpg) 

**No.1 5KPlayer – Free MOV Video Player for Mac & Windows** 

Supporting all video music including MOV M4V MP4 M4A MP3 H.264 in QuickTime format and WMV WMA ASF in Windows media format, 5KPlayer can be the best free MOV file player for both iMac/MacBook/MacBook Air/MacBook Pro powered by macOS Mojave (or earlier) and Surface Pro 4/Dell XPS 13/Samsung Galaxy TabPro S/HP Spectre x360 13 shipped with windows 10/8/7.

Namely, QuickTime for Windows 10/8/7 is not very confugurable and QuickTime won't play MP4 problem happens now and then. It's indeed the inherent [MOV player for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/), but QuickTime Player is not so satisfactory to play all MOV files as only MOV file encoded with MPEG-4 or H.264 video and AAC audio is supported by QuickTime. Inferior to 5KPlayer, MP4 MKV AVI won't play on Mac happens often unless you download the specific codec, converting the file format or intall the plug-in on QuickTime.

### What is .MOV and How to Play?

MOV format is a QuickTime media container format, developed by Apple Computer Inc. It is natively supported by such MOV file players as QuickTime Player. Yet despite all that, some MOV files cannot be played in QuickTime Player casually. MOV is a multimedia container format that can include one or more tracks, each of which stores a particular type of data: audio, video, effects, or text (e.g. for subtitles). Thus, MOV players such as QuickTime may have trouble to process all MOV files successfully.

Compared with Mac users, Windows users make MOV playing much harder. MOV isn't accepted by Windows Media Player, except for Windows Media Player 12\. If you believe that you only need to download Windows Media Player 12 for MOV playback on Windows, you are totally wrong. This is because Windows Media Player 12 is only available for Windows 7 and later. If you are working on older versions like Windows Vista, you are highly recommended to try another MOV video player like 5KPlayer.
