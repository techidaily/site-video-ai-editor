### 2. Vegas Pro

Vegas Pro is one of the most well-known budget options out there when it comes to video editing. It actually started out as editing software for audio (podcasts, radio shows, etc.), but then expanded over time. Because of those beginnings, many people have found that it is one of the best options you’ll have available when it comes to audio editing within a film. It’s also very versatile – you don’t need anything but a Windows PC in order to run it.

## Part 2: Filmmaking Software to Improve Workflow

### 2. StudioBinder

Keeping up with the production process takes a lot of work, and Studio Binder was specially designed to help you take care of those things more easily. From script breakdowns (which keep everyone in the loop as to what is next in filming) to lists where you keep track of what shots you’ve taken and which you need to take, it has everything you need to keep your entire team on track throughout the entire process of filming.

### 3. Storyboarder

Keeping up with the story and everything around it during the filming process can take a lot of work. That’s why many filmmakers suggest putting together what is known as a storyboard – a rough draft of the storyline, put together in a fashion so that you can follow everything and check it all out properly. Storyboarder is a software package that helps you to visualize everything, check out if the story works, and keep up with your ideas (even if you get distracted during filming).

### 4. Adobe Audition

Sometimes, you need something that is a little more advanced and focused when it comes to putting together the sound mix in a way that is pleasing to the ears. Adobe Audition is one of the most popular options for this, because it has all of the tools necessary so that you can get the perfect balance and fullness of sound in your film. Your sound is just as important as your videography, so picking this up can be really helpful in the long run.

### 5. Evernote

Organization is absolutely essential when you’re trying to put a film together and, because of that, you’re likely exploring a lot of different options that can help you to stay organized. Evernote is a lovely option and it’s available for computers and for phones/tablets, so you can take it anywhere with you. You can put together task lists, keep notes on what’s going on during the filming process, and more. It’s a really simple program to use and it’s quite easy to import and export info from it.

### 6. Google Docs

Google Docs is part of the Google Suite, and it’s a smart word processing program that has all of the flexibility of programs like Microsoft Word. One of the biggest differences, however, is the ability to collaborate and work on the same document without the need to send it back and forth via email. Changes are updated in real time, so you can work on a document together, even if you aren’t in the same vicinity.

## Conclusion

Do some research on the web and find the options that work best for your team’s budget and for how you plan on working on your films. You can find plenty of low-budget software that can help to make your film look great without breaking the budget you’ve set into place.
