## Trouble Shoot macOS Sierra Media Playback Problems

 _Posted by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last update: April 28, 2020_

Experiencing **macOS Sierra media playback issues** already? Can't play MKV files nor can it read some certain MP4 files. You are not alone.

However, to clarify the trouble, you should know what you are calling a "macOS Sierra video playback issue" is actually OSX default player's problem, ie. QuickTime's fault. Do not throw the blame at the whole macOS platform system. It is essentially the osx player that makes you out at elbows.

Step 6 Click on "Change All". 

By following this simple guide, you can make any player your default on Mac. Or if you'd like to get rid of QuickTime totally, refer to [QuickTime uninstall guide](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/).

Nevertheless, If you are a diehard QT user who is reluctant to change its default status, you can consider our top recommended codec packs for QT macOS Sierra: Perian, L-lite for Mac, LAV, CCCP, etc. or you can search the exclusive format codec pack for Mac on Softonic or Google. With these codec packs installed, even if there is a codec support problem, you can overcome it without paying additional efforts.

Also, instead of installing any codec packs, there is another wise move - you can convert the file into MP4 which can be easily read by QuickTime. 5KPlayer by default can only convert downloaded files into MP3 audio. Therefore, to convert the file, you need a proper converter like MacX Video Converter Pro. Refer to [Guide On MKV to MP4 Conversion](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/youtube-download/).

## macOS Sierra Playback Issue Regarding A Specific File

If a player can playback a general container format on Mac yet unable to read a specific media file, you might want to instantly check the file itself - use **Mediainfo** to view the file details and see if it is broken.Some players does not support decoding H.265 VP8/VP9 codecs natively, so if you find any codec-incompatibility, install the corresponding codec you need or just change a player. 

Note that some high-res high color depth videos like 8K 10bit videos cannot be properly played on your Mac computer, which is probably due to relatively poor computer specs. To playback 4K 8K videos, you might want to refer to [4K 8K video playback guide](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/).
