**Apply transitions & animations to video**

The Movie Maker features lots of transitions under Animations tab. You can choose from wipes, cinematics, shatters, sweeps and curls, patterns and shapes, reveals, diagonals and dissolves.

Note: if you use the default themes, you won’t see all these transitions. Check the detailed steps about [How to Add Transitions in Windows Movie Maker](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Apply visual effects to video**

We’ve introduced some of the best visual effects software before, but in Windows Movie Maker, you can also add effects such as 3D Ripple, Black and White, Blur, pixelate, mirrors, motions and fade effects.

**Change video speed of video**

The Movie Maker Edit tab allows you to adjust video volume, add fade in and fade out effects to video, or change video speed.

#### 3. Save Video

After finish editing, you can upload your video clips to Facebook, YouTube, and other social media, or burn your videos to DVD with Windows DVD maker. You can also save your video clips on your computer.
