After you create a new project and import a video clip into the app, you have to tap on the Speed icon. A slider that enables you to reduce a video’s playback speed to 1/8 of its original speed or make it twice as fast will appear on the screen, so you can drag it left or right to set a new playback speed for your video.

If you are not happy with the results, you can tap on the Reset button, and iMovie will return the playback speed of your video clip to its normal value.

**Pros**

* Free and easy playback speed adjustment process
* The app is compatible with all iOS-based devices
* Supports 4K video editing
* Offers a wide range of video editing tools

**Cons**

* Lacks the versatility of professional video editing apps
* Audio editing options could be better

Still can’t decide which video editing app to use for changing video speed? I’ve made a comparison table, hoping that can help you decide.
