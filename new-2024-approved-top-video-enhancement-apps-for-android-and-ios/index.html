<p>Brightening an iPhone video can help you see the activity on-screen and make it more appealing if you share it on social media or post it to a website.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Move your fingers upward on the iPhone screen to brighten the scene when you begin filming. This may be done at any moment while the video is being recorded.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>There are a ton of <strong>Video Brightening Editor Apps</strong> that will make brightening the videos after filming quite easy for you.

And if you’ve invested in an iPhone 13 Pro or iPhone 13 Pro Max that can capture video in the high-resolution ProRes standard, you’ll find reliable software to make the most of your video. We’ll go over which applications are excellent for specific chores and provide statistics to help you discover the best match. Let’s get started!</p>
<h2 id="Apple-Apps-for-Video-Editing-You-Should-Try"><a href="#Apple-Apps-for-Video-Editing-You-Should-Try" class="headerlink" title="Apple Apps for Video Editing You Should Try"></a>Apple Apps for Video Editing You Should Try</h2><p>In today’s world, photos and videos are an integral part of everyone’s life. Mobile phones, laptops, and cameras may all be used to capture them. But, it might not be easy to organize and decorate them according to one’s unique preferences. Fortunately, there are several tools available to help Apple users with these tasks.</p>
<p>In the following part, I will introduce 5 best apple video editing software, including its unique features listed.</p>
<h3 id="1-Photos"><a href="#1-Photos" class="headerlink" title="1. Photos"></a>1. Photos</h3><p><strong>Supported By:</strong> iOS&#x2F;macOS&#x2F;iPadOS</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free to use</p>
<p>The number one on our list is the Photos app. It’s among the most well-known application for video editing enthusiasts in the iOS community. This is an application mostly used by professional designers and developers who are into the video editing profession.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with Photos App?</strong></p>
<p>Apple Inc. created Photos, a picture storage and editing program. Its main features are its simplicity and ease of usage. Its very name is a lovely and obvious indication of its use. Since 2015, this Mac picture editing app has been offered for OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 and tvOS v.10.</p>
<p>Filters and Smart Sliders are among the editing tools available in this program. It also has the Mark-up tool that allows you to <strong>add text</strong>, shapes, and doodles, as well as signatures. What’s more, you can <strong>rotate, crop and auto enhance</strong> videos in this app as well. Like photos editing, if you are not satisfied with the editing, you can tap <strong>Revert</strong> to restore to the original version.</p>
<p>If you are using the Photos app on iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro, you can <strong>adjust the focus points and the depth of the field</strong> in Cinematic mode to make a cinematic-looking video easily.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edit Videos Anywhere with iCloud Photo Library</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The connection with iCloud Picture Library is where Photos outperforms every other Mac image editing tool. This fantastic feature allows users to fill out their libraries rather than their devices. This is accomplished by syncing photographs and videos across all Apple devices, including the iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, MacBook and Apple Watch.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Moments</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Photos employs Moments as an organizer, which may be used to build categories and years. Moments are a mix of the photo’s time and location information. Furthermore, facial recognition enables users to create groups based on a person, among other things.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Themes</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Themes, which allow users to make calendars, picture albums, and other projects, complement the modifying and organizing capabilities. The program also provides printing capabilities for professional results.</p>

<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free to use</p>
<p>Next on our list is the QuickTime Player that lets you do almost whatever you want to do with your videos and pictures. The app is built to support both beginners and professionals. However, we would lean more towards beginners because most professionals today prefer apps like iMovie or Final Cut Pro. But that’s not to say this one doesn’t have excellent features to offer.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with QuickTime Player App?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trim, Combine,</strong> <strong>Rotate, Split MOV Video</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone wants to make their lengthy videos short. QuickTime allows you to do precisely that with its trimming feature. Make your videos short and catchy with this feature. Further, you can combine two videos to make one excellent video for your presentation. The app also allows you to split different videos and combine them to produce more quality content.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Record Screen and Voiceover</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you think your video footage can do well with a background voiceover of someone else, QuickTime Player allows you to record your audios in the background while your video plays smoothly. You can also record the desktop screen with the Player.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Shrink Video</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you believe your video looks better with a small size in appearance, try shrinking it using the shrink feature in the QuickTime Player. You can lower the video quality from 1080p, 720p to whatever your phone or Mac storage deems compatible.</p>
<h3 id="3-Clips-3"><a href="#3-Clips-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Clips"></a>3. Clips</h3><p><strong>Supported By:</strong> iOS&#x2F;iPad</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free to Use</p>
<p>You might not have heard of Clips as much as you may have heard about the others on this list. But don’t sleep on this one. Clips have slowly but surely gained the attraction of expert video editors, and you’d see almost all of them having Clips on their iPhones or Macs.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with Clips?</strong></p>
<p>Apple Clips is interesting to check out when you’re an iOS fan. You can use this free video editing app to record and edit 16:9, 4:3 or square videos with various camera effects, stunning filters, animated text, music, emoji, stickers, and more, and then share it with your friends or family.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Family-Oriented</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Apple Clips is mainly oriented towards families and children, and it isn’t even close to the capabilities of iMovie. Nonetheless, it is moving closer to be a genuine video editing program with each new version.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AR Spaces</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Apple Clips, for instance, introduced AR Spaces, an augmented reality function for iPhone 12 Pro and iPad Pro owners, in April.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cinematic Mode</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, the most recent version in September enables you to import and edit video shot in Cinematic mode on the iPhone 13 and ProRes footage from the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max.</p>
<h3 id="4-iMovie-3"><a href="#4-iMovie-3" class="headerlink" title="4. iMovie"></a>4. iMovie</h3><p><strong>Supported By:</strong> iOS&#x2F;iPadOS&#x2F;macOS</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free to use</p>
<p>One of the most recognizable apps in the Apple market for video editing software is the iMovie app. Almost all professional experts are reaping the benefits of using the iMovie app. The app developers have emphasized greatly equipping the professionals and the newbies who so desperately want to make their mark into the video editing profession.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with iMovie?</strong></p>
<p>iMovie, is more like Final Cut Pro X’s younger sibling. But it’s free with your Mac, so there’s no danger in giving it a shot. It’s an excellent option for newcomers learning to use editing software, casual enthusiasts, and even YouTubers who wish to cut up their films.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Merge, Cut, Trim: Pull off Everything!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Although iMovie is rather simple, this may be considered a benefit for inexperienced editors. You can combine, cut, and rearrange your original video and audio with iMovie.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>4K Video Editing</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You may even export your work in 4K quality at up to 60 frames per second once you’ve done it. Many effects, transitions, filters, and fine-tuning settings for white balance, color matching, and audio isolation are also included.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cinematic Mode</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In September, iMovie received a major upgrade, which included importing and editing footage taken in Cinematic mode on the iPhone 13 to Macs. You may now add, tweak, and delete focus points, as well as change the depths of field effect in a video shot in Cinematic mode, assuming you have a modern iPhone or iPad.</p>
