It enables people to upload video, audio and more in order to create “mixes” or movies. The most impressive feature is that you can export videos to mobile devices, PC and YouTube. Until now, it’s considered as the best online video editor and is getting better and better since released in 2007.</p><p>JayCut has everything you need to have a free video editing trial, including default videos, images and audio. You even don’t need to register to use all the functions. However, once registered, you get free and easier to share movies with family and friends.</p><h2 id="Online-video-editor-JayCut-review"><a href="#Online-video-editor-JayCut-review" class="headerlink" title="Online video editor JayCut review"></a>Online video editor JayCut review</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/jaycut.jpg"                      alt="jaycut online video editing"                ></p><p><strong>Pros</strong>: JayCut does all you could imagine in a single web page. Actually, it amazes me and my friends. I like everything about this website. It is very user friendly and allows you to upload different types of media very quickly, and then mix them together. The mixing becomes more of a work of art and one feels a sense of ownership when then have added titles, transitions and music to their pictures or video. Lastly I really like the fact that each person creates his or her own profile page. The profile makes it a fun way of learning about other people and it can be fun because it is similar to Facebook or Myspace.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> If people would expect more, maybe the develop team could add more transitions and text effects, and suit the needs to export to facebook and a choice to select DVD service.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Jaycut is a quick and easy-to-use website video editor. It’s fun and interactive. The design is so intuitive that people could easily understand how to use everything the website offers.</p><h2 id="How-to-Use-Online-Video-Editor-JayCut"><a href="#How-to-Use-Online-Video-Editor-JayCut" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Online Video Editor JayCut"></a>How to Use Online Video Editor JayCut</h2><p>Al through JayCut is superb easy to use, you could get quick start before trying this absolutely free online video editor.<br>Step 1.

A file with the .mpeg or .mpg extension is generally compressed by MPEG-1 or MPEG-2. Although MP4 is part of the MPEG-4 video system, it uses more advanced video codecs like H264&#x2F;H265&#x2F;MPEG4 that deliver higher compression efficiency than MPEG-1 and MPEG-2. MP4 files are smaller than MPEG and compatible with more devices and software. After converting MPEG to MP4, you can watch the converted videos on most of your players without any limit.</p><h3 id="Handy-MPEG-to-MP4-Converter"><a href="#Handy-MPEG-to-MP4-Converter" class="headerlink" title="Handy MPEG to MP4 Converter"></a>Handy MPEG to MP4 Converter</h3><p>WonderFox HD Video Converter Factory Pro helps you convert from MPEG to MP4, AVI, WMV, MOV, MKV, and other formats &amp; devices.

You’d better update it to the latest version to ensure it works properly.<br>Step 2: Change the import settings by clicking on the menu bar and selecting “<strong>Music</strong>” &gt; “<strong>Preferences (Edit)<strong>”.<br>Step 3: Click on “</strong>Import Settings</strong>” from the “<strong>Files (General)<strong>” tab and then select “</strong>MP3 Encoder</strong>” from the “<strong>Import Using</strong>” section.

The easy-to-use interface allows even the naivest users to adapt the video skills quickly plus it being easy-on-eyes also enables you to edit videos seamlessly. Given the dedicated options for everything — tripping &amp; cutting videos to adding audio, photos, and subtitles — editing videos will not take time.</p><p><a href="https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/google_play.jpg"                      alt="Download filmora"                > </a> <a href="https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/apple_store.jpg"                      alt="Download filmora"                ></a></p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>New upgrades have brought Advanced Crop features</li><li>You can set duration of video motion</li><li>Filmora includes all the basic video-editing features you might expect, like cutting, merging, cropping, and rotating video footage</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Filmora does have a free version, but the video will be watermarked</li></ul><p><strong>Price:</strong></p><p><strong>Free version available</strong></p><p>Filmora Pro (1 Year) — $32.99</p><p>Filmora Pro （1 Month） — $6.99</p><p>Remove Logo Roll — $4.99more</p><h3 id="2-LumaFusion-best-for-iPad"><a href="#2-LumaFusion-best-for-iPad" class="headerlink" title="2.

However, unlike Filmora, LumaFusion does not make it simple for an average Joe to utilize the application to its full extent.

Yes, it lacks some bells and whistles, but it makes basic video editing a breeze. Suitable for beginners, iMovie’s main aim is to provide ease of use in a clean and elegant interface. In all, you will not find advanced video-editing options.

How to Make VLC Upscale Video Quality?</h2><p>In this section, we’ll delve into the video quality settings available in VLC Media Player and how can you adjust them to let VLC upscale video quality. But note that upscaling a low-quality video to a high-quality video with perfect clarity in VLC is impossible. The improvement will be limited by the video’s original quality. </p><h3 id="1-Adjust-Effect-Setting-for-Better-Display-Effects"><a href="#1-Adjust-Effect-Setting-for-Better-Display-Effects" class="headerlink" title="1. Adjust Effect Setting for Better Display Effects"></a>1. Adjust Effect Setting for Better Display Effects</h3><p>VLC offers options to change the video’s Hue, Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, Gamma, Sharpen, etc., helping improve the overall visual clarity. Here are the steps:</p><p>▪ Open VLC and go to <strong>Tools</strong> on the menu bar.<br> ▪ From the drop-down options, select <strong>Effects and Filters</strong>.<br> ▪ Click <strong>Video Effects</strong> and go to <strong>Essentials</strong>.<br> ▪ Check the <strong>Image adjust</strong> and move the sliders below to set the preferred Hue, Brightness, Contrast, etc. If your video looks fuzzy, you can try the <strong>Sharpen</strong> effect to make it clear.<br> ▪ As you alter the settings, you can preview the changes in real time. </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.videoconverterfactory.com/tips/imgs-self/vlc-upscaling/vlc-upscaling-01.webp"                      alt="Adjust Effect Setting in VLC"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.videoconverterfactory.com/tips/imgs-self/vlc-upscaling/vlc-upscaling-01-01.webp"                      alt="Adjust Effect Setting in VLC"                > </p><p>With the above steps, the changes are directly applied to the video you’re playing in VLC.

Adjust Video Color Settings or Change Output Settings</h3><p>Many Nvidia card users have encountered the washed-out color issue when playing videos in VLC. If you have been troubled with the same problem, then walk along with the guide below to correct the black levels of your video:</p><p>▪ Type <strong>Nvidia Control Panel</strong> in the Windows search bar and open it.<br> ▪ Go to <strong>Advanced Settings &gt; Video</strong>.<br> ▪ Then click <strong>Adjust video color settings</strong> and check the option “<strong>with the NVIDIA settings</strong>”.<br> ▪ Below the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab, change the <strong>Dynamic range</strong> to <strong><em>full (0-255)</em></strong>.<br> ▪ Then restart VLC to put it into effect. </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.videoconverterfactory.com/tips/imgs-self/vlc-upscaling/vlc-upscaling-04.webp"                      alt="Adjust Video Color Settings"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.videoconverterfactory.com/tips/imgs-self/vlc-upscaling/vlc-upscaling-04-04.webp"                      alt="Adjust Video Color Settings"                > </p><p>If you fail to bring up the Nvidia Control Panel or the above method doesn’t make any improvement, the issue might be with the use of YUV, which is a television standard. You can keep going with the following steps to cancel it: </p><p>▪ Start VLC and go to <strong>Tools &gt; Preferences</strong>.<br> ▪ Switch to <strong>Video</strong> and select <strong>DirectX (DirectDraw) video output</strong>.<br> ▪ Then uncheck the <strong>Hardware YUV-&gt;RGB conversions</strong> option.<br> ▪ Don’t forget to restart the VLC player. </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.videoconverterfactory.com/tips/imgs-self/vlc-upscaling/vlc-upscaling-05.webp"                      alt="Disable the Hardware YUV Option in VLC"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.videoconverterfactory.com/tips/imgs-self/vlc-upscaling/vlc-upscaling-05-05.webp"                      alt="Disable the Hardware YUV Option in VLC"                > </p><p>Here is another workaround you can try to enhance the output video quality in VLC: </p><p>▪ Start VLC and enter the <strong>Preference</strong> settings.<br> ▪ Choose to show <strong>All</strong> settings.<br> ▪ On the left panel, click <strong>Video</strong> and double-click <strong>Output modules</strong>.<br> ▪ Choose <strong>Direct3D11</strong>.<br> ▪ Then on the right side of the window, select <strong>Super Resolution</strong> from the <strong>Video Upscaliing Mode</strong> drop-down menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.videoconverterfactory.com/tips/imgs-self/vlc-upscaling/vlc-upscaling-06.webp"                      alt="VLC Change Output Settings"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.videoconverterfactory.com/tips/imgs-self/vlc-upscaling/vlc-upscaling-06-06.webp"                      alt="VLC Change Output Settings"                > </p><h3 id="4-Activate-the-RTX-Video-Super-Resolution-Feature-in-VLC"><a href="#4-Activate-the-RTX-Video-Super-Resolution-Feature-in-VLC" class="headerlink" title="4.

Activate the RTX Video Super Resolution Feature in VLC</h3><p>With the support for RTX Video Super Resolution, VLC does help increase the clarity and sharpness of videos, but it is far from being a game-changer. And some users even reported an instant crash when enabling this feature in VLC. But it is still worth trying. Before activating it, please ensure you have installed the newest VLC (3.0.19 or later) and have a PC running GeForce RTX 30- and 40-series graphics cards.</p><p>▪ Open the Nvidia Control Panel.<br> ▪ Navigate to <strong>Video &gt; Adjust video image settings</strong>.<br> ▪ In the RTX video enhancement box, check the <strong>Super resolution</strong> option.<br> ▪ Select the desired level of upscaling from the <strong>Quality</strong> drop-down options. <strong>Level 4</strong> delivers the best performance, but also requires the most GPU resources.<br> ▪ Finally, apply the changes. </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.videoconverterfactory.com/tips/imgs-self/vlc-upscaling/vlc-upscaling-07.webp"                      alt="Activate the RTX Video Super Resolution"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134242/18498" target="_top" id="2134242">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134242" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134242/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.videoconverterfactory.com/tips/imgs-self/vlc-upscaling/vlc-upscaling-07-07.webp"                      alt="Activate the RTX Video Super Resolution"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115909/19272" target="_top" id="2115909">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115909" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115909/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->  <h2 id="Part-2-Try-Easier-Alternative-to-Improve-Video-Quality"><a href="#Part-2-Try-Easier-Alternative-to-Improve-Video-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.
