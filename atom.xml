In fact, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >buying presents <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for those you care about the most, won’t necessarily reflect how you feel, so this year you can try making something for them.</p><p><strong>Creating a short Valentine’s Day video</strong> shouldn’t be too hard, especially if you have a great story to tell. Besides, a video is something that will last, and your significant other will always be able to watch it no matter what the future brings. So, in this article, we are going to show you how to make a Valentine’s Day video on your Windows PC or Mac, or just with your mobile phones that will truly show how you feel.</p><h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Valentine’s-Day-Video-on-Windows-and-Mac"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Valentine’s-Day-Video-on-Windows-and-Mac" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Valentine’s Day Video on Windows and Mac"></a>How to Make a Valentine’s Day Video on Windows and Mac</h2><p>There are hundreds of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editing software for Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Mac computers you can use to create a Valentine’s Day video, but in this article, we are going to use Filmora as an example. However, each of the steps we will cover can be used in other video editors for Mac and Windows. Let’s check how to make a Valentine’s Day video with Filmora.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><h3 id="1-It-all-starts-with-an-Idea"><a href="#1-It-all-starts-with-an-Idea" class="headerlink" title="1. It all starts with an Idea"></a>1. It all starts with an Idea</h3><p>Creating any type of video without having a well-developed idea is virtually impossible because you won’t know which footage to use. Moreover, having an idea of how you want the final draft of the video to look will make it easier for you to select the footage you intend to use during the video editing process.</p><p>Once you know exactly what you want to do you can start shooting or collecting the footage you are going to include in your Valentine’s Day video. After you have all the video files you need, place them in one folder, launch Filmora, create a new project and proceed to import the footage by dragging and dropping the files to the editor’s Media tab.</p><h3 id="2-Organize-the-Footage-on-the-Timeline-and-Enhance-the-Colors"><a href="#2-Organize-the-Footage-on-the-Timeline-and-Enhance-the-Colors" class="headerlink" title="2. Organize the Footage on the Timeline and Enhance the Colors"></a>2. Organize the Footage on the Timeline and Enhance the Colors</h3><p>During the next step, you should add all video clips you would like to use in your video to the timeline. You can do this by simply dragging a particular video file from the Media tab and dropping it to the desired location on the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/drag-n-drop-timeline.jpg"                      alt="Drag and drop valentines video footage to Filmora"                ></p><p>Optionally, you can use the Split tool to make cuts in a video clip and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >remove parts you don’t want to include in the final version of the video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. When done, you should right-click on each of the video clips you added to the timeline and select <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >the Color Correction <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> option. You can then proceed to fine-tune the Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, or Highlights values depending on how bright or vivid the colors in the original video are. This process can take a while, which is why it is important to be patient and go through it slowly.</p><h3 id="3-Add-Romantic-Filters-and-Elements"><a href="#3-Add-Romantic-Filters-and-Elements" class="headerlink" title="3. Add Romantic Filters and Elements"></a>3. Add Romantic Filters and Elements</h3><p>Filmora features Effects and Elements libraries that contain hundreds of different image overlays, filters, and predesigned elements you can add to your project. You just need to click on the Effect or Elements icons in the upper right corner of the screen to start browsing these libraries.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valentines-special-event-elements.jpg"                      alt="Drag and drop valentines element to video in Filmora9"                ></p><p>Once you find a romantic filter or element you want to apply to your footage, you should simply drag and drop it to the video track that is located directly above the one on which your footage is located. You should then position an <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >overlay, a filter, or an element <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at the exact spot where you want them to appear in your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valentines-special-event-transitions.jpg"                      alt="Drag and drop valentines transitions  to video in Filmora9"                ></p><p>In case you want to adjust the intensity of an effect you applied you should just double-click on it and then use the Alpha slider to adjust the effect’s intensity. Double-clicking on an element you placed on the timeline will grant you access to the Video tab where you can rotate it, change its on-screen position, or set its Opacity value.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><h3 id="4-Apply-Text-Layers"><a href="#4-Apply-Text-Layers" class="headerlink" title="4. Apply Text Layers"></a>4. Apply Text Layers</h3><p>The Titles tab contains more than a hundred different Openers, End Credits, or Titles options you can use in all of your projects. Simply pick the one that best matches the style of your video, then add it to the timeline and double-click on it in order to start customizing it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valentines-special-event-titles.jpg"                      alt="Drag and drop valentines texts and titles  to video in Filmora9"                ></p><p>Once you <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >insert the text <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you can pick the font, color, or this size of the text, as well as set the spacing between two lines of text. Optionally, you can use Filmora’s Advanced Text Edit window if you want to have complete control over all layers of text you add to your video.</p><h3 id="5-Create-the-Soundtrack"><a href="#5-Create-the-Soundtrack" class="headerlink" title="5. Create the Soundtrack"></a>5. Create the Soundtrack</h3><p>Music will give your video the rhythm and it will make it more entertaining to watch, which is the reason why you shouldn’t skip this step. In case, you already have an audio file you would like to use as a soundtrack for your Valentine’s Day video, you can import it into Fimora the same way you would import a video file. You can then add it to an audio track and adjust its duration so that it matches the duration of the entire video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-audio-library.jpg"                      alt="add music for valentines video in Filmora9"                ></p><p>You can also use Filmora’s library of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty-free songs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to create the soundtrack for the video you are making. Just head over to the Audio tab, pick a song from Electronic, Rock, or Tender &amp; Sentimental categories, and add it to the timeline.</p><h3 id="6-Export-the-Video"><a href="#6-Export-the-Video" class="headerlink" title="6. Export the Video"></a>6. Export the Video</h3><p>When done with all these steps, you should preview the video you’ve created and if you like the results click on the Export button. You can then proceed to select the video format in which your video is going to be exported, choose the preferred resolution or the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >frame rate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Furthermore, Filmora lets you export all videos directly to your YouTube or Vimeo channels, which can save you a lot of time on uploading videos to these video hosting platforms. Nonetheless, how long the rendering process is going to take depends on your computer’s processing power.</p><h2 id="Creating-Videos-with-Valentine-Video-Maker-for-Android"><a href="#Creating-Videos-with-Valentine-Video-Maker-for-Android" class="headerlink" title="Creating Videos with Valentine Video Maker for Android"></a>Creating Videos with Valentine Video Maker for Android</h2><p>If you find the process of making a Valentine’s Day video on Mac and Windows computers a bit too technical, then an app like <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sigmaappsolution.valentinevideomaker&hl=en_US&gl=US" >Valentine Video Maker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that lets you edit photos and videos from your Android phone is the perfect option for you. You can install the app for free and use its video editing tools to combine photos and video clips into a captivating Valentine’s Day video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/valentine-video-maker-app-android.jpg"                      alt="Valentines Video Makers App for Android"                ></p><p>Creating slow motion or fast forward videos is yet another option you’ll have at your disposal if you choose to edit your videos with this app. The best part is that you can create a new video with Valentine Video Maker in just a few minutes and share it on social media.</p><h2 id="Using-Valentines-Video-Greetings-Maker-on-iPhones"><a href="#Using-Valentines-Video-Greetings-Maker-on-iPhones" class="headerlink" title="Using Valentines Video Greetings Maker on iPhones"></a>Using Valentines Video Greetings Maker on iPhones</h2><p>Even though there are lots of different video editing apps for iPhones, very few of them enable their users to create customized Valentine’s Day messages. So if you would like to surprise the person you love with a beautiful Valentine’s Day message, you should install <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/valentines-greetings-maker/id804531269" >Valentines Video Greetings Maker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valentines-greetings-maker-ios-app.jpg"                      alt="Valentines Video Makers App for iPhone"                ></p><p>The app lets you combine an unlimited number of images or videos and record your own customized voice message to accompany the video you created. Each video greeting you create can be shared on social media with a single tap or sent directly via email. Keep in mind that you must make an in-app purchase in order to be able to save your video greetings to the Photo Gallery.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Making something special for the person you love is going to make this year’s Valentine’s Day a day to remember. All you need to accomplish this is a video editing software like Filmora and a great idea for a Valentine’s Day video.

In case you’ve never heard of it, VirtualDub2 is a free video editing and capture tool for both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows systems. Although it has many useful features, it lacks some of the more complex editing capabilities of other programs. Because of its ability to do quick linear operations on videos, VirtualDub mp4 has become a popular choice for many people throughout the globe.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/virtualdub-poster.jpg"                      alt="virtualdub-poster"                ></p><h2 id="Best-VirtualDub-Alternative-for-VirtualDub-windows-10"><a href="#Best-VirtualDub-Alternative-for-VirtualDub-windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Best VirtualDub Alternative for VirtualDub windows 10"></a>Best VirtualDub Alternative for VirtualDub windows 10</h2><p>Filmora Video Editor for Windows (and Filmora Video Editor for Mac) is the greatest alternative to VirtualDub mp4 or vdubmod for people who do not want to deal with substandard video and audio editing software.

Moreover, Windows 10 doesn’t have a built-in app that is dedicated solely to video editing.</p><p>However, you shouldn’t panic if you are looking for <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editing software for Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> since there are plenty of free and affordable options to choose from. In fact, finding an app you can use to polish your videos on PC computers, shouldn’t be too difficult even if you have no previous video editing experience.</p><p>That is why in this article we are going to take you through some of the best iMovie replacements for Windows 10 you can use to create stunning videos that are going to attract the attention of your online audience.</p><h2 id="Top-5-iMovie-Replacements-for-Windows-10-Free-Paid"><a href="#Top-5-iMovie-Replacements-for-Windows-10-Free-Paid" class="headerlink" title="Top 5 iMovie Replacements for Windows 10 [Free &amp; Paid]"></a>Top 5 iMovie Replacements for Windows 10 [Free &amp; Paid]</h2><p>iMovie isn’t designed to perform demanding video editing tasks, which is the reason why we selected the video editing software products that are aimed at newcomers to the video editing world. So let’s take a look at some of the best video editing apps for Windows 10 you can use as a replacement for iMovie.</p><h3 id="1-Windows-10-Photos-App"><a href="#1-Windows-10-Photos-App" class="headerlink" title="1. Windows 10 Photos App"></a>1. Windows 10 Photos App</h3><p>The Photos app is the only built-in app on Windows 10 that offers video editing features. Even though the app is designed to help PC users view, organize and edit photos, you can still use it to perform basic video editing tasks.</p><p>You can either choose to start working on a new project from scratch or to create a video automatically. In case you decide to make a video automatically, you just have to select the footage, name your project and wait for the Photos App to generate a new video for you.</p><p>Opting to edit your footage manually will enable you to trim or split video clips, alter their playback speed and apply filters to the footage. Optionally, you can also add text layers to your videos, use motion effects to simulate camera movement, or use some available 3D filters. Exporting projects in resolutions higher than 1080p or uploading your videos directly to social media from the Photos app isn’t an option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows10-automatic-created-video-with-photos-app.jpg"                      alt="Editing videos in iMovie Alternative Photos App on Windows10"                ></p><h3 id="2-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#2-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="2. Wondershare Filmora"></a>2. Wondershare Filmora</h3><p>If you are looking for a video editing app for Windows 10 that enables you to edit the videos recorded with action cameras, Smartphones, or DSLRs, then Filmora is probably one of your best options.</p><p>Wondershare’s video editor provides support for 4K videos, and it is compatible with almost all commonly used video file formats. Starting a new project or importing the footage into Filmora is a straightforward process that requires a minimum amount of effort. Creating the opening titles, enhancing the colors in video clips, applying filters and image overlays are just a few among the countless video editing options Filmora provides.</p><p>What’s more, the video editor is equipped with a music library that contains a selection of royalty-free songs, which enables you to create a soundtrack even if you don’t have the music you can use in your videos. You can export all your projects to your accounts on Vimeo or YouTube directly from Filmora, but you should keep in mind that all videos created with the free version of this video editor are going to be watermarked.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><h3 id="3-Adobe-Rush"><a href="#3-Adobe-Rush" class="headerlink" title="3. Adobe Rush"></a>3. Adobe Rush</h3><p>Most of the applications that are included in Adobe’s Creative Suite are designed to meet the demands of professional users. However, the Adobe Rush app that is compatible with desktops and Smartphones is easy to use, and it enables you to edit even while you are on the go.</p><p>Adobe Rush enables you to capture and edit your footage from one place, and it stores all your projects on the cloud so that you can open them with Adobe Premiere Pro if you want to perform advanced video editing tasks.</p><p>The app offers instructions at every step of the video editing process, which means that you don’t need any previous video editing experience to create a new video with Adobe Rush. Moreover, sharing the videos you edit with this app on Instagram, Facebook or other social media platforms won’t take much more than a few moments of your time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filter-in-adobe-rush.png"                      alt="Editing videos in iMovie Alternative Adobe Rush"                ></p><h3 id="4-Shotcut"><a href="#4-Shotcut" class="headerlink" title="4. Shotcut"></a>4. Shotcut</h3><p>This is an open-source cross-platform video editing app that provides support for nearly all audio, image and video file formats, which makes it a perfect choice for PC users who often work with 4K footage.</p><p>You can use Shotcut to detach audio from video, set keyframes, or cut and trim each clip you add to the editor’s timeline. This video editing software features a rich library of transitions, which enables you to avoid hard cuts in your videos.</p><p>Moreover, Shotcut has all the tools you’re going to need in order to fine-tune the colors in each clip you want to include in the final cut of your video. The software’s audio editing capabilities are equally impressive, you can easily fade in and fade out audio files, control their volume or apply filters to them. The best part is that Shotcut doesn’t have demanding system requirements, so you can use it on computers that don’t have a lot of processing power or powerful graphics cards.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shotcut.jpg"                      alt="Editing videos in iMovie Alternative Shotcut"                ></p><h3 id="5-CyberLink-PowerDirector-365"><a href="#5-CyberLink-PowerDirector-365" class="headerlink" title="5. CyberLink PowerDirector 365"></a>5. CyberLink PowerDirector 365</h3><p>PowerDirector 365 is equipped with a plethora of tools that allow you to create social media videos almost automatically. You can choose from a rich selection of video templates that already contain titles, effects, transitions, then choose the footage you would like to include in your video, and the video editor will do the rest for you.</p><p>Besides, the automatic video editing options, PowerDirector 365 offers support for all professional cameras and video file formats. Moreover, this video editing software grants you access to advanced motion tracking options, chroma key visual effects, and a variety of powerful video editing features that can help you create videos that are going to stand out on social media.</p><p>However, you need at least 4 GB of RAM as well as 7 GB of free space on your PC’s hard drive in order to use PowerDirector. Even so, the software has CPU and GPU performance-boosting technology that is compatible with Nvidia, AMD Radeon, Ryzen and Intel graphics cards.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cyberlink-powerdirector-interface.jpg"                      alt="Editing videos in iMovie Alternative  PowerDirector"                ></p><h2 id="Aspects-You-Need-to-Consider-while-Choosing-the-iMovie-Replacement-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Aspects-You-Need-to-Consider-while-Choosing-the-iMovie-Replacement-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Aspects You Need to Consider while Choosing the iMovie Replacement for Windows 10"></a>Aspects You Need to Consider while Choosing the iMovie Replacement for Windows 10</h2><p>Determining which video editing app for Windows 10 you should choose is going to be much easier if you already know which types of videos you want to create. Moreover, the editor you choose has to offer support for the file format or the resolution in which the video was captured. Here are some of the most important factors you need to consider before installing a new video editor on your computer.</p><h3 id="1-4K-Video-Editing-Support"><a href="#1-4K-Video-Editing-Support" class="headerlink" title="1. 4K Video Editing Support"></a>1. 4K Video Editing Support</h3><p>Recording videos in 4K resolution has become more popular in recent years, as Smartphones and action cameras started offering this option. So if you are recording 4K videos often, you need video editing software that enables you to edit the videos recorded in this resolution. Moreover, you need to make sure that the video editing app you’re interested in allows you to export projects in 4K resolution.</p><h3 id="2-Cross-device-Capability"><a href="#2-Cross-device-Capability" class="headerlink" title="2. Cross-device Capability"></a>2. Cross-device Capability</h3><p>Social media content creators often want to share their videos just moments after recording it. So, if you are often creating videos you share on social media, you should choose a video editor that is also compatible with iPhones and Android devices. Having the option to edit videos from both your Smartphone and your computer will make it much easier to share fresh content on social media.</p><h3 id="3-Built-in-Features-Resource"><a href="#3-Built-in-Features-Resource" class="headerlink" title="3. Built-in Features &amp; Resource"></a>3. Built-in Features &amp; Resource</h3><p>The number of video editing tools, the sizes of audio and video effects libraries, or how many transitions a video editing software offers are all the factors you need to consider before you opt for one option or the other. On the other hand, getting a video editing app for Windows 10 that offers advanced video editing tools is only a good option if you are planning to learn how to use these tools.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Even though Windows 10 no longer has an iMovie equivalent, it is still relatively easy to find a video editing app for Windows 10 you can use to edit your footage quickly before sharing it with your friends on social media.</p><p>You don’t need to have a ton of video editing experience in order to create videos with video editors like Filmora or Adobe Rush.

A melodious sound helps the video editors deliver information and creatively and define the tone of their narrative.</p><p>Sound effects (SFX) refer to audio clips or sounds that are not part of the recoded video. They are added to movies, documentaries, video games, and even reality shows to invoke the viewers’ emotions and increase their interest in the video.</p><p>Similarly, the addition of sound effects increases the production value and creates a complete audience experience. If you want to elevate your video dramatically and make it magnetic, have to balance sound effects, silence, and music in such a way that they support each visual and every cut. Although audio cannot fix slipshod editing or amateur camera work, it becomes more crucial than video quality while you are trying to deliver a specific message in your video.</p><p>Professional video editors and filmmakers consider sound effects crucial to their video quality. A clear, melodious, and well-balanced audio adds depth to the visuals, evokes more emotions than the picture, and paints the audio picture of a particular setting.</p><p>Even silence, a powerful tool of the audio arsenal, speaks louder than the picture itself. Hence, balancing audio by adding sound effects can make your video stimulating, captivating, and emotional.</p><p>That’s why a good editing tool always stocks a great number of sound effects for users, like <strong>Filmora</strong>. Click to download and take a look at all the effects in Filmora <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"                                     ></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Sound effects are external audio files added to the videos to make them look interesting and worth watching. A perfect balance of sound, music, and silence allows the filmmakers to define the tone of their narrative and deliver their message creatively.</p><p>You can create sound effects through self-recording or by downloading them from external resources. To add sound effects to your video, use professional video-editing software like Final Cut Pro or Filmora.

Just click on the “Film Clip” icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-2.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><p>It will open a new window screen on your computer to select the video from the directory. Find the clip you want to import and cut. Use your mouse to select it and click the “Open” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-3.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><p>The video will be loaded in the “Media” folder of Filmora. The clip’s thumbnail should be visible to assure you have done everything correctly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-4.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><p>If you can see that, let’s go to the next step.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Drag and Drop Video to Filmora’s Timeline</strong></p><p>Select the video in the media folder by clicking over it once. Now, without leaving the hold of the left button of your mouse, slide the video down to the track in the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-5.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><p>After that, a message will pop up, asking about your preference for the project settings. It is recommended to choose the “Match to Media” option unless you’re an experienced video editor who knows how to play with the resolution and frame rates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-6.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><p>You will see the video on the timeline with its preview on the “Preview Screen” on the right side of the interface.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-7.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Cutting Your Video in Filmora</strong></p><p>Here comes the core step you have been waiting for. But before you go any further, you need to know about the “Playhead.”</p><p>Playhead is an orange-reddish marker you can find on the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-8.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><p>It has an important role in cutting your videos.</p><p>So, move the playhead to your desired frame and click on the “scissor” icon to make the “starting” cut.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-9.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><p>As soon as you do it, you will see that the single clip is now divided into two parts similar to this image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-10.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><p>The “Red” marked area in the above screenshot ensures a gap between the clips on the timeline. The “Yellow” arrows confirm two separate clips of the same video.</p><p>Place the two clips together as seen in this “Green” area.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-11.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><p>And place the playhead anywhere on the clip. And click on the “scissor” icon once again to make the “ending” cut (second cut).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-12.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-13.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><p>If done correctly, there should be three clips now of the same video, as you can observe in this screenshot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-14.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><p>Again, the “Red” area in the above photo indicates the gap, and the “Yellow” area ensures a third segment of the video.</p><p><strong><em>Note</em></strong><em>: The gaps you can see in the divided clips are made intentionally for understanding. Practically, Filmora doesn’t move the clip or make gaps in between after you have made the cuts.</em></p><p>Keep in mind that there are three clips on the timeline. Now, if you want to remove the second clip from the video, you need to select that portion first by clicking on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-15.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><p>Then, right-click on the mouse and choose “Cut” from the menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-16.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><p>Within a semi-second, the selected portion will be removed from the timeline. And you will be able to see the remaining parts of the video. Now, pull the second clip using your mouse and place it at the end of the first clip without leaving a gap in between.</p><p>Then, click the “Play” button under the preview screen to see the results.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-17.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-18.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><p>You can see in the above two screenshots that there’s a jump between the scenes due to cuts, confirming that video has been cut significantly.</p><p><strong>Step 5: Trimming Your Video in Filmora</strong></p><p>Remember that cutting and trimming in Filmora are two different things. Trimming allows you to remove a particular video part from visibility without deleting the portion.</p><p>So feel free to skip this step if you’re happy learning the cutting technique. But if you’re interested in trimming, here’s how you do it.</p><p>Take your mouse cursor at the beginning or end of the clip you want to trim. Keep holding the clip’s corner and slide the mouse back or front to trim the part</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-19.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> <em>Since the trim tool doesn’t delete the video, the final project based on trimming will be of a larger size. Therefore, it is advised to cut videos rather than trimming for fast rendering, better results, and small video size.</em></p><p><strong>Step 6: Save Project and Export Your Cut&#x2F;Trimmed AVI Video</strong></p><p>Choose “Save Project” from the “File” menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-20.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><p>Select the directory to save the project, rename the new video, and click the “Save” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-21.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><p>Click on the “Export” button to save the video in AVI or any other video format of your choice on your computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-22.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Top-3-Free-AVI-Video-Cutter-on-Windows"><a href="#Part-2-Top-3-Free-AVI-Video-Cutter-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Top 3 Free AVI Video Cutter on Windows"></a>Part 2: Top 3 Free AVI Video Cutter on Windows</h2><p>As a Windows user, finding an excellent video cutter is relatively easy.

Unlike typical video editors, this open-source tool includes limited options to rip Blu-rays and DVDs. Moreover, you can mix the 5.1 soundtracks and convert them to stereo to make the audio compatible with your TV speakers.</p><p>But the exciting thing about Handbrake is that you can use this software on your macOS 10.13 or later versions to cut AVI videos for free. However, it’s a bit technical process, as there’s no timeline to help you trim or make cuts on the clips directly with the help of your mouse.</p><p>You are required to mention a time range (seconds, minutes, or hours) to keep a specific part of the video while the software removes the non-ranged parts of the clip. For instance, you have a video of 10 seconds. You start the range from 5 seconds and end it at 10 seconds.

A growing number of laptop and desktop PCs no longer feature optical disc drives, while the discontinuation of the Windows Media Center marked the end of an era in which Windows OS offered a built-in DVD player.</p><p>The Windows 10 doesn’t have a native app that enables you to play movies or music from DVD and Blu-ray discs, and you must install a third-party DVD <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to view content from these sources.

Ocean Footage underwater sample"></a>1. Ocean Footage underwater sample</h4><p>This one is first on my choice of 4K video sample for a couple of reasons, firstly I love the subject matter, and secondly from a technical perspective it is one of the best samples out there.</p><p>Filmed using a Red One camera, it displays the vibrancy and detail that we associate with 4K resolution at its best, the color depth of the fish and coral is astounding, and when the shot moves to a passing whale the sense of scale the resolution gives really shows what 4K is capable of, and why it is a step up from anything we have seen before.</p><h4 id="2-Trailer-for-the-movie-‘Elysium’"><a href="#2-Trailer-for-the-movie-‘Elysium’" class="headerlink" title="2. Trailer for the movie ‘Elysium’"></a>2. Trailer for the movie ‘Elysium’</h4><p>Very little movie production footage is easily available out there in 4K, but this is one of the exceptions. The full theatrical trailer for the movie in glorious Ultra HD, Why does this make the list? Well I think if you are wanting to see the benefits of 4K, then samples like the Ocean Footage one mentioned above really show off the technical prowess, but it is actual movies that most people will be wanting to use 4K kit for, and this gives you a very good indication of how much of an increase in clarity, detail and vibrancy can be gained by switching to 4K. The standard HD version of this trailer is readily available too, so this is something you could make a direct comparison with. The nature of the film, a sci-fi action film, also lends itself to 4K with lots of beautifully rendered CGI scenes in the trailer to look at.</p><h3 id="3-Timescapes"><a href="#3-Timescapes" class="headerlink" title="3. Timescapes"></a>3. Timescapes</h3><p>This is the trailer for an interesting project, filmed entirely in 4K and the work of one man, it is purported to be the first 4K film made available for sale. The film itself, and this trailer, is a simple concept, slow-motion and time lapse cinematography of the South West of America, taken as the director, Tom Lowe, travels around in his pickup truck. The concept itself makes for an interesting effect, but this sample is here because of the content. Watching the big expanses of nature flow by in 4K is simply mind blowing, here you really see the almost 3D effect so much resolution and detail bring to the medium, it isn’t like watching a video, it really is like looking out of a window at real life.</p><h3 id="4-Boat-Scenes"><a href="#4-Boat-Scenes" class="headerlink" title="4. Boat Scenes"></a>4. Boat Scenes</h3><p>There are actually several test videos on this subject, all of them do a good job of displaying 4K but for me it is the this one that focuses on passing boats against an expansive backdrop that is the one to look at. Again it shows the effect of 4K resolution when displaying the wider world around us, this time a harbor vista as the boat passes through it, detail can be seen in the water, the passengers on the boat and the backdrop, and the sense of realism and scale, which for me are the things that set 4K apart, are readily apparent here.</p><h3 id="5-Tears-of-Steel-trailer"><a href="#5-Tears-of-Steel-trailer" class="headerlink" title="5. Tears of Steel trailer"></a>5. Tears of Steel trailer</h3><p>Another rare 4K movie trailer, this one again shows lots of very high quality CGI that really show off the capabilities of 4K at their best. Some great use of the depth of field that 4K emphasizes in a lot of the shots and overall provides a great insight into 4K and what you can expect from it. An interesting video that also manages to tell a little story as well as being a showcase.</p><h3 id="6-Sintel"><a href="#6-Sintel" class="headerlink" title="6. Sintel"></a>6. Sintel</h3><p>Sintel is an animated short created in the blender animation program, here in 4K it represents a fantastic look into what 4K can offer all forms of media, the opening scene, with the snow blowing in the wind, for instance, enables you to see incredible detail that just isn’t visible within the standard HD version. Seeing individual flies as the character searches through the wreckage of a town is another high point in terms of technical prowess.</p><p>Another feature of Sintel is its soft focus look that accentuates the high resolution, and makes this video stand out from others in the list. The small dragon is well animated and the main characters features, particularly the hair, are incredibly well realized. A great way to showcase your 4K equipment.</p><h3 id="7-Stock-Footage-Sample"><a href="#7-Stock-Footage-Sample" class="headerlink" title="7. Stock Footage Sample"></a>7. Stock Footage Sample</h3><p>This one is an amalgam of short clips from commercial stock footage that is used a sample of the product. That doesn’t make it any less of a fantastic 4K clip however, with footage chosen specifically to show off the benefits of 4K at its very best (it is a promotional package after all) there is something here for everyone. From the glorious colors of a sunrise to the explosions and the amazing time lapse, with, again, fantastic and vibrant colors, a real showcase for 4K in the true sense of the word.</p><h3 id="8-Honey-Bees"><a href="#8-Honey-Bees" class="headerlink" title="8. Honey Bees"></a>8. Honey Bees</h3><p>Back to nature for this one, and the eponymous Honey Bee. Showing not only the color rendition and detail of the surroundings, it also captures the Bees themselves in incredible fidelity, the wing detail, especially on the close-ups, is just way beyond anything we have seen from moving images before, high resolution stills? Certainly, but not video. Another great advert for 4K footage and a lovely film as well.</p><h4 id="9-Skyfall-Trailer"><a href="#9-Skyfall-Trailer" class="headerlink" title="9. Skyfall Trailer"></a>9. Skyfall Trailer</h4><p>Can’t say I’m much of a fan of the films, but as a way to see what very fast action looks like in 4K this is a great one. Unlike the other movie trailers, this one isn’t full of CGI, so it shows a different aspect of 4K movies here, the real-life stunts performed by traditional stunt professionals is what this one is all about. And it doesn’t let us down, crashes, explosions and car chases, everything that Bond is about. Except in 4K. Great.</p><h4 id="10-Fireworks"><a href="#10-Fireworks" class="headerlink" title="10. Fireworks"></a>10. Fireworks</h4><p>This one is just a lot of fun. Fireworks, in 4K. Color rendition, detail, it has it all. It opens with a magnificent view across the city showing the lights at dusk and beyond, and then into the stunning firework display, it really is quite spectacular and a great look at 4K footage.</p><p>That’s our top 10, not all the best technically, but each offers something a little different to give a taste of what 4K is all about, and exactly what your 4K screen is capable of.</p><p>There are multiple 4K video converters with powerful functions. However, if video converting is new to you, consider <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/videoconverter/download/" >Wondershare UniConverter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out.

A growing number of laptop and desktop PCs no longer feature optical disc drives, while the discontinuation of the Windows Media Center marked the end of an era in which Windows OS offered a built-in DVD player.</p><p>The Windows 10 doesn’t have a native app that enables you to play movies or music from DVD and Blu-ray discs, and you must install a third-party DVD <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to view content from these sources.

You should also check a player’s compatibility with the operating system you have installed on your computer and that you have all the codecs necessary to play ISO and other image, audio and video file format. So let’s take a look at ten best free DVD players for Windows 10.</p><h3 id="1-VLC-Media-Player-by-VideoLan"><a href="#1-VLC-Media-Player-by-VideoLan" class="headerlink" title="1.

But, when it doesn’t, here are some things you can try to get your system back to normal in no time.</p><p>Here’s the quick list:</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Quit and restart Final Cut Pro</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Check your media</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Delete render files and re-render</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Create a new library</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Create a new user account</a></li><li><a href="#part6">Trash FCP X Preferences</a></li><li><a href="#part7">Remove and re-install Final Cut Pro</a></li></ul><h4 id="1-Quit-and-restart-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#1-Quit-and-restart-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="1 Quit and restart Final Cut Pro"></a>1 Quit and restart Final Cut Pro</h4><p>Restarting Final Cut releases and refreshes memory so that if something was confusing your system, restarting Final Cut can fix it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/restart.png"                      alt="restart fcp" title="restart fcp"                ></p><h4 id="2-Check-your-media"><a href="#2-Check-your-media" class="headerlink" title="2 Check your media"></a>2 Check your media</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/image-size.png"                      alt="check your media" title="check your media"                ></p><p>Frequently, problems are caused by still images that are too big. Limit your digital photos to no more than 5,000 pixels on a side. Final Cut is a video editor, not a still image editor. Images that are too large cause problems.</p><p>Also, stock footage files are known to cause problems. Be sure to convert all stock footage to ProRes 422 before importing into Final Cut Pro X.</p><h4 id="3-Delete-render-files-and-re-render"><a href="#3-Delete-render-files-and-re-render" class="headerlink" title="3 Delete render files and re-render"></a>3 Delete render files and re-render</h4><p>Open your Project in the Timeline and choose File &gt; Delete Project Render Files. Render files can become corrupt. Trashing them forces Final Cut to create new render files which often will fix the problem.</p><h4 id="4-Create-a-new-library"><a href="#4-Create-a-new-library" class="headerlink" title="4 Create a new library"></a>4 Create a new library</h4><p>Create a new library and a new project. Then, copy and paste sections of the old project into the new project. Test each section until you find the spot that doesn’t work. At which point, you can remove or replace the bad media.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/new-project.png"                      alt="Create a new library" title="Create a new library"                ></p><h4 id="5-Create-a-new-user-account"><a href="#5-Create-a-new-user-account" class="headerlink" title="5 Create a new user account"></a>5 Create a new user account</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/new-ccount.png"                      alt="Create a new user account" title="Create a new user account"                ></p><p>Open System Preferences &gt; Accounts and create a new User Account. This resets all preferences for both Final Cut and the operating system back to factory defaults. The only problem with doing this is that a new user account can’t access files stored in the Home directory of the old user account. For this reason, I always recommend storing all libraries on external hard drives, not the Home Directory.</p><h4 id="6-Trash-FCP-X-Preferences"><a href="#6-Trash-FCP-X-Preferences" class="headerlink" title="6 Trash FCP X Preferences"></a>6 Trash FCP X Preferences</h4><p>Trash Final Cut Pro X preference files.
