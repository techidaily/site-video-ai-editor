There is no need for a heavyweight video editor that is generally used by professionals. Besides, an industry-grade video editor demands high-end computer as they put pressure on your system resources for video processing and rendering.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you do not have a high-end computer for video editing, a lightweight video editor is perfect for you. There are so many lightweight video editing software applications available to choose from for video editing. We have picked the best light video editing software for smooth and satisfying video editing work.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-The-Features-for-Light-Video-Editor"><a href="#Part-1-The-Features-for-Light-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. The Features for Light Video Editor"></a>Part 1. The Features for Light Video Editor</h2><p>Here are the main features of a good lightweight video editor that you should be aware of.</p>
<p>Small File Size – A light video editor comes in a small size file, and you will understand the file size when you download it on your computer. Ideally, a light video editor should not be above a couple of hundred MBs in size.</p>
<p>Wide OS Compatibility – A good light video editor should not only be compatible with the latest version of computer operating system but also with older versions. This is because older operating systems fail to run a heavyweight video editor smoothly.</p>
<p>Low System Requirements – Every video editor lists out their system requirements starting from processor version to RAM capacity and free disk space. A light video editor should have low system requirements such as 4GB RAM, 5GB free disk space, Intel i3 or likewise.</p>
<p>Low CPU Usage – How much CPU resource a video editor uses determines whether the video editor is truly lightweight. You can monitor how much CPU resource an application is using from Task Manager. For a light video editor, it should never be more than 33% of the total CPU usage at any given time.</p>
<p>Faster Processing – A lightweight video editor is generally faster in processing and rendering videos. They use different techniques such as compression, background processing and proxy workflow to boost processing speed without affecting system performance.</p>

<h5 id="Benjamin-Arango"><a href="#Benjamin-Arango" class="headerlink" title="Benjamin Arango"></a>Benjamin Arango</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p>
<p>Thanks to strong Internet connections, faster processing technology, and Cloud computing, there are now hundreds of free online video trimmer websites.</p>
<p>Yet, it is difficult to figure out which is the best and which is the worst. Some are just awful, and others are a little suspicious and&#x2F;or malicious.</p>
<p>If you are struggling to figure out which online video trimmer is for you, then here is a list of the 10+ best free online video trimmers.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers"><a href="#Why-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers" class="headerlink" title="Why Free Online Video Trimmers?"></a>Why Free Online Video Trimmers?</h2><p>Why would anybody use free “Online” video trimmers when there are so many good offline (downloadable) trimmers a person can use? Windows even has its own installed video trimmer. Simply right click your video, navigate to “Open With” and then click on “Photos.” At the top right of the GUI is an icon called “Edit &amp; Create.” Click it and it takes you to the editing function where you may trim your video.</p>
<p>The sad part is that the pre-installed video editor for Windows is just like the one for Mac. It is slow to process, it is very basic, and it doesn’t allow you to edit frame-by-frame. As a result, most people prefer a free online video trimmer as opposed to a pre-installed tool or third-party video trimmer app.</p>
<h2 id="10-Best-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers"><a href="#10-Best-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers" class="headerlink" title="10+ Best Free Online Video Trimmers"></a>10+ Best Free Online Video Trimmers</h2><p>There are many reasons why online trimmers are preferred. Many times, the sorts of video trimmers one downloads are full of malware, bloatware, and ransomware. Even the ones that claim to be clean have suspicious obvious security holes.</p>
<p>Another common reason is that many online trimmers allow trimming and conversions in formats, file types, and resolutions that downloadable programs do not. Also, even the world’s best free downloadable video trimmer <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.blender.org/" >Blender.org <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, is so viciously complicated that one would need weeks of tutorials just to figure out how to use it.</p>
<p>In many cases, the simplest and most straight-forwards answer is to use an online trimmer. To quickly upload, trim, convert, maybe add effects, and then download. It is quicker, easier, and often runs a smaller risk of security breaches, ID theft, and malware problems.</p>
<p>So in this part, I review the 10+ best online video trimmers that are easy to use for beginners and those who just need a few of cuts. Among them on the top is video cutter from Wondershare.</p>

<p>The name may be a little uninspired, but the video cutter is not a bad online tool. It is nestled in between a series of other simple online tools such as a voice recorder, file converter and so forth. You do not need to download this tool. You start by clicking the “Open File” button.</p>
<p>Pick the video you wish to trim, and then wait for it to upload. It takes a while to upload your video because the servers are not great. Once the video is uploaded, you are able to use the simple tools the website has to offer in order to trim your video.</p>
<p>There is a bit of advertising on the website, but mostly the web master is hoping for donations to keep the website running. Since the website doesn’t make much money, it cannot afford to pay for better bandwidth or better servers, which is why it sometimes takes quite a while to upload, trim, and then download. But, it is free, so it is difficult to complain.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular opinion, the YouTube video trimmer tools are pretty poor quality. But, they ride high on this list because of their amazing server speeds and storage capacity. There are plenty of video editors that will cut out if you try to upload larger files, but the YouTube Creator Studio will not.</p>
<p>YouTube has billions of dollars behind it because it is owned by Google. A common problem with online video trimmers is that they take too long to upload and download. That is still a problem with the YouTube system, but it is still one of the fastest uploading and downloading video tools on the Internet.</p>
<p>Another problem with other online trimmers is that it is difficult to upload large videos. Many online trimmers will freeze or crash, which means all the uploading was for nothing. But, the YouTube system will not crash or freeze. You simply leave your computer alone, and eventually it will upload your file (even large files). For these reasons, the YouTube Creator Studios tool rides pretty high up this list.</p>

<p>The Video Toolbox system sits on a very cheaply made website that is pretty darn ugly. But, this tool reaches the number four position because it is rather more advanced than one has come to expect from a free video trimmer and editor.</p>
<p>The tool is free, and it can process video files of up to 1500MB, which is not a massive amount, but it is about the size of three episodes of the Simpsons. This tool can convert your video files to a wide range of other file types. You may also alter the bit rate, audio codec, video codex, frame rate, sample rate and channels.</p>
<p>This tool also comes with online features that allow you to re-download your previous videos, see your recent file outputs, and delete your log files. It is also able to pull items from your videos such as meta data, subtitle files, and so forth. Plus, the tool allows you to merge videos and crop videos with just a few clicks.</p>

<p>The WeVideo tool is an online editor. It is a video trimmer windows compatible program that will run off of your Edge web browser. The tool is pretty easy to use, it is fairly fast and flexible. The sad part is that this tool offers a series of seemingly perfect tool functions, but it asks for money for them.</p>
<p>For example, the video trimmer is free, but the green-screen tool is not. They always ask you to turn your free account into a paid account, which is very annoying. Yet, this tool reaches number five on this list because the GUI for the video trimmer is great, and the level of support for this system is pretty good too.</p>

<p>This video editor is another video trimmer free service. The GUI is pretty ugly, but it is the sort of simple tool that gets to the point and gets there pretty quickly. The biggest downside is that the free video trimmer will only accept up to 50MB of data. This is not very much. It is the sort of amount you may upload to Instagram.</p>
<p>The tool is very lightweight, which means the pages are less likely to crash or freeze. It also means that the editor loads quickly and doesn’t lag as you use it. If other editors were this simple, then far fewer people would feel the need to download video trimming software.</p>

<p>If you are looking to trim your videos, then this is a good place for uploading and trimming 4K videos. It also allows you to share videos, and if you pay, then you can store RAW videos. The online movie editor and movie maker allow you to trim your videos frame-by-frame. This is perfect for people who need precision when they are trimming their videos. It is also the sort of tool that more advanced users may enjoy.</p>

<p>This is possibly one of the simplest tools on this list, which is good in most cases, but some may need a little more in order to do a good job. There is however a function that offers a little more flexibility than other tools. Once your video is uploaded, you can choose a different output file from over ten different file types.</p>
<p>You can specify which part of the video you wish to cut prior to uploading. This saves a lot of processing time when the video is uploaded, which is probably going to suit people who have a lot of small videos to cut and who do not want to wait around for the website to respond. You are able to upload up to 200MB, which is not great, but it is also not terrible. It is around the size of four music videos, or a mobile-episode of a US sitcom.</p>

<p>This tool has a very user-friendly interface. It has the sort of simple interface that beats out websites like SnapChat, WhatsApp and so forth. The website that hosts the tool says that you do not need experience to use their editing tools, and that is probably true. The biggest downside to this tool, and the reason it sits on the number nine spot, is that they will not let you use the tool without signing in.</p>
<p>It may not seem like such a big deal to have to sign into an account, but it is just for marketing purposes. It also allows them to sell you other services that they offer. If you are only looking to trim your videos, then there are far simpler ways to do it through the online trimmers listed in this article.</p>
<p>If you are looking for more of an online editor, then maybe you should consider the Clip Champ. Suffice it to say that this is not the best tool for quick and simple video trims because there are other tools listed on this article that are much faster.</p>

<p>This is a great tool with a fairly simple interface. You can see your videos as you trim them. And, you can edit your videos, gone their settings, add text, and so forth. Yet, it is only their simplest functions that are for free. The trimming function is free, but many of the editing tools are not.</p>
<p>This would not normally be a problem, but this website is always dangling its other products and its prices in front of you. If you are just looking to trim a file, then the adverts for their services can become annoying. The tool renders and works well on web browsers, so it may be of interest to people who are willing to pay for semi-professional editing tools.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-Which-Suits-You-the-Best"><a href="#Conclusion-Which-Suits-You-the-Best" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion - Which Suits You the Best?"></a>Conclusion - Which Suits You the Best?</h2><p>There are tools on this article for most types of trimming jobs. There are tools that will quickly upload and process your smaller videos, which is suitable for people making social media videos. Then, there are tools that will take a large and bulky file, and are good for people who are very conscious about the file output and video quality.</p>
<p>It is a pity that some of these tools ask for money to use their other editing services. But, if you want to trim your videos for free, then all of these tools on this article will help you.</p>

<p>Thanks to strong Internet connections, faster processing technology, and Cloud computing, there are now hundreds of free online video trimmer websites.</p>
<p>Yet, it is difficult to figure out which is the best and which is the worst. Some are just awful, and others are a little suspicious and&#x2F;or malicious.</p>
<p>If you are struggling to figure out which online video trimmer is for you, then here is a list of the 10+ best free online video trimmers.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers-1"><a href="#Why-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers-1" class="headerlink" title="Why Free Online Video Trimmers?"></a>Why Free Online Video Trimmers?</h2><p>Why would anybody use free “Online” video trimmers when there are so many good offline (downloadable) trimmers a person can use? Windows even has its own installed video trimmer. Simply right click your video, navigate to “Open With” and then click on “Photos.” At the top right of the GUI is an icon called “Edit &amp; Create.” Click it and it takes you to the editing function where you may trim your video.</p>
<p>The sad part is that the pre-installed video editor for Windows is just like the one for Mac. It is slow to process, it is very basic, and it doesn’t allow you to edit frame-by-frame. As a result, most people prefer a free online video trimmer as opposed to a pre-installed tool or third-party video trimmer app.</p>
<h2 id="10-Best-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers-1"><a href="#10-Best-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers-1" class="headerlink" title="10+ Best Free Online Video Trimmers"></a>10+ Best Free Online Video Trimmers</h2><p>There are many reasons why online trimmers are preferred. Many times, the sorts of video trimmers one downloads are full of malware, bloatware, and ransomware. Even the ones that claim to be clean have suspicious obvious security holes.</p>
<p>Another common reason is that many online trimmers allow trimming and conversions in formats, file types, and resolutions that downloadable programs do not. Also, even the world’s best free downloadable video trimmer <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.blender.org/" >Blender.org <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, is so viciously complicated that one would need weeks of tutorials just to figure out how to use it.</p>
<p>In many cases, the simplest and most straight-forwards answer is to use an online trimmer. To quickly upload, trim, convert, maybe add effects, and then download. It is quicker, easier, and often runs a smaller risk of security breaches, ID theft, and malware problems.</p>
<p>So in this part, I review the 10+ best online video trimmers that are easy to use for beginners and those who just need a few of cuts. Among them on the top is video cutter from Wondershare.</p>

<p>The WonderShare Filmora program is littered with features you can use if you are willing to download its program and use it on your device. It has a free version that you can download, but what most people do not know is that it has a video trimmer online.</p>
<p>The <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >free online video trimmer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> allows you to upload a video, and then edit it within your web browser. Once your video is uploaded, you are able to edit and trim it in minutes. You may also change the output format. You may set the video trim using the manual tool that allows you to look at your video as it plays. Or, you may use the start and end function and simply enter the starting position and finishing position.</p>
<p>Exporting and downloading is very easy, and there is no obligation to buy one of their other tools. The odd thing is that most people do not know this service is even available. Most people think that the website is simply full of editing tools. Most are unaware there are any free online tools.</p>
<p>Just like many users known, Wondershare has a desktop video editor for Windows and Mac that is very easy and simple to use, named <strong>Filmora</strong>. it’s very powerful for beginners. You can download it for free now.</p>

<p>The name may be a little uninspired, but the video cutter is not a bad online tool. It is nestled in between a series of other simple online tools such as a voice recorder, file converter and so forth. You do not need to download this tool. You start by clicking the “Open File” button.</p>
<p>Pick the video you wish to trim, and then wait for it to upload. It takes a while to upload your video because the servers are not great. Once the video is uploaded, you are able to use the simple tools the website has to offer in order to trim your video.</p>
<p>There is a bit of advertising on the website, but mostly the web master is hoping for donations to keep the website running. Since the website doesn’t make much money, it cannot afford to pay for better bandwidth or better servers, which is why it sometimes takes quite a while to upload, trim, and then download. But, it is free, so it is difficult to complain.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular opinion, the YouTube video trimmer tools are pretty poor quality. But, they ride high on this list because of their amazing server speeds and storage capacity. There are plenty of video editors that will cut out if you try to upload larger files, but the YouTube Creator Studio will not.</p>
<p>YouTube has billions of dollars behind it because it is owned by Google. A common problem with online video trimmers is that they take too long to upload and download. That is still a problem with the YouTube system, but it is still one of the fastest uploading and downloading video tools on the Internet.</p>
<p>Another problem with other online trimmers is that it is difficult to upload large videos. Many online trimmers will freeze or crash, which means all the uploading was for nothing. But, the YouTube system will not crash or freeze. You simply leave your computer alone, and eventually it will upload your file (even large files). For these reasons, the YouTube Creator Studios tool rides pretty high up this list.</p>

<p>This is possibly one of the simplest tools on this list, which is good in most cases, but some may need a little more in order to do a good job. There is however a function that offers a little more flexibility than other tools. Once your video is uploaded, you can choose a different output file from over ten different file types.</p>
<p>You can specify which part of the video you wish to cut prior to uploading. This saves a lot of processing time when the video is uploaded, which is probably going to suit people who have a lot of small videos to cut and who do not want to wait around for the website to respond. You are able to upload up to 200MB, which is not great, but it is also not terrible. It is around the size of four music videos, or a mobile-episode of a US sitcom.</p>

<p>This is a great tool with a fairly simple interface. You can see your videos as you trim them. And, you can edit your videos, gone their settings, add text, and so forth.

<p>Thanks to strong Internet connections, faster processing technology, and Cloud computing, there are now hundreds of free online video trimmer websites.</p>
<p>Yet, it is difficult to figure out which is the best and which is the worst. Some are just awful, and others are a little suspicious and&#x2F;or malicious.</p>
<p>If you are struggling to figure out which online video trimmer is for you, then here is a list of the 10+ best free online video trimmers.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers-2"><a href="#Why-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers-2" class="headerlink" title="Why Free Online Video Trimmers?"></a>Why Free Online Video Trimmers?</h2><p>Why would anybody use free “Online” video trimmers when there are so many good offline (downloadable) trimmers a person can use? Windows even has its own installed video trimmer. Simply right click your video, navigate to “Open With” and then click on “Photos.” At the top right of the GUI is an icon called “Edit &amp; Create.” Click it and it takes you to the editing function where you may trim your video.</p>
<p>The sad part is that the pre-installed video editor for Windows is just like the one for Mac. It is slow to process, it is very basic, and it doesn’t allow you to edit frame-by-frame. As a result, most people prefer a free online video trimmer as opposed to a pre-installed tool or third-party video trimmer app.</p>
<h2 id="10-Best-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers-2"><a href="#10-Best-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers-2" class="headerlink" title="10+ Best Free Online Video Trimmers"></a>10+ Best Free Online Video Trimmers</h2><p>There are many reasons why online trimmers are preferred. Many times, the sorts of video trimmers one downloads are full of malware, bloatware, and ransomware. Even the ones that claim to be clean have suspicious obvious security holes.</p>
<p>Another common reason is that many online trimmers allow trimming and conversions in formats, file types, and resolutions that downloadable programs do not. Also, even the world’s best free downloadable video trimmer <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.blender.org/" >Blender.org <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, is so viciously complicated that one would need weeks of tutorials just to figure out how to use it.</p>
<p>In many cases, the simplest and most straight-forwards answer is to use an online trimmer. To quickly upload, trim, convert, maybe add effects, and then download. It is quicker, easier, and often runs a smaller risk of security breaches, ID theft, and malware problems.</p>
<p>So in this part, I review the 10+ best online video trimmers that are easy to use for beginners and those who just need a few of cuts. Among them on the top is video cutter from Wondershare.</p>
<h4 id="1-Wondershare-Filmora-Online-Video-Trimmer-2"><a href="#1-Wondershare-Filmora-Online-Video-Trimmer-2" class="headerlink" title="1.

<p>The WonderShare Filmora program is littered with features you can use if you are willing to download its program and use it on your device. It has a free version that you can download, but what most people do not know is that it has a video trimmer online.</p>
<p>The <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >free online video trimmer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> allows you to upload a video, and then edit it within your web browser. Once your video is uploaded, you are able to edit and trim it in minutes. You may also change the output format. You may set the video trim using the manual tool that allows you to look at your video as it plays. Or, you may use the start and end function and simply enter the starting position and finishing position.</p>
<p>Exporting and downloading is very easy, and there is no obligation to buy one of their other tools. The odd thing is that most people do not know this service is even available. Most people think that the website is simply full of editing tools. Most are unaware there are any free online tools.</p>
<p>Just like many users known, Wondershare has a desktop video editor for Windows and Mac that is very easy and simple to use, named <strong>Filmora</strong>. it’s very powerful for beginners. You can download it for free now.</p>

<p>The name may be a little uninspired, but the video cutter is not a bad online tool. It is nestled in between a series of other simple online tools such as a voice recorder, file converter and so forth. You do not need to download this tool. You start by clicking the “Open File” button.</p>
<p>Pick the video you wish to trim, and then wait for it to upload. It takes a while to upload your video because the servers are not great. Once the video is uploaded, you are able to use the simple tools the website has to offer in order to trim your video.</p>
<p>There is a bit of advertising on the website, but mostly the web master is hoping for donations to keep the website running. Since the website doesn’t make much money, it cannot afford to pay for better bandwidth or better servers, which is why it sometimes takes quite a while to upload, trim, and then download. But, it is free, so it is difficult to complain.</p>
<h4 id="4-YouTube-Creator-Studio-2"><a href="#4-YouTube-Creator-Studio-2" class="headerlink" title="4. YouTube Creator Studio"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/creators/" >YouTube Creator Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

<p>Contrary to popular opinion, the YouTube video trimmer tools are pretty poor quality. But, they ride high on this list because of their amazing server speeds and storage capacity. There are plenty of video editors that will cut out if you try to upload larger files, but the YouTube Creator Studio will not.</p>
<p>YouTube has billions of dollars behind it because it is owned by Google. A common problem with online video trimmers is that they take too long to upload and download. That is still a problem with the YouTube system, but it is still one of the fastest uploading and downloading video tools on the Internet.</p>
<p>Another problem with other online trimmers is that it is difficult to upload large videos. Many online trimmers will freeze or crash, which means all the uploading was for nothing. But, the YouTube system will not crash or freeze. You simply leave your computer alone, and eventually it will upload your file (even large files). For these reasons, the YouTube Creator Studios tool rides pretty high up this list.</p>

                      alt="free online video trimmer"
                ></p>
<p>The Video Toolbox system sits on a very cheaply made website that is pretty darn ugly. But, this tool reaches the number four position because it is rather more advanced than one has come to expect from a free video trimmer and editor.</p>
<p>The tool is free, and it can process video files of up to 1500MB, which is not a massive amount, but it is about the size of three episodes of the Simpsons. This tool can convert your video files to a wide range of other file types. You may also alter the bit rate, audio codec, video codex, frame rate, sample rate and channels.</p>
<p>This tool also comes with online features that allow you to re-download your previous videos, see your recent file outputs, and delete your log files. It is also able to pull items from your videos such as meta data, subtitle files, and so forth. Plus, the tool allows you to merge videos and crop videos with just a few clicks.</p>

                      alt="free online video trimmer"
                ></p>
<p>The WeVideo tool is an online editor. It is a video trimmer windows compatible program that will run off of your Edge web browser. The tool is pretty easy to use, it is fairly fast and flexible. The sad part is that this tool offers a series of seemingly perfect tool functions, but it asks for money for them.</p>
<p>For example, the video trimmer is free, but the green-screen tool is not. They always ask you to turn your free account into a paid account, which is very annoying. Yet, this tool reaches number five on this list because the GUI for the video trimmer is great, and the level of support for this system is pretty good too.</p>
<h4 id="7-Wincreator-Video-Cutter-2"><a href="#7-Wincreator-Video-Cutter-2" class="headerlink" title="7. Wincreator Video Cutter"></a>7. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.wincreator.com/video-cutter" >Wincreator Video Cutter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="free online video trimmer"
                ></p>
<p>This video editor is another video trimmer free service. The GUI is pretty ugly, but it is the sort of simple tool that gets to the point and gets there pretty quickly. The biggest downside is that the free video trimmer will only accept up to 50MB of data. This is not very much. It is the sort of amount you may upload to Instagram.</p>
<p>The tool is very lightweight, which means the pages are less likely to crash or freeze. It also means that the editor loads quickly and doesn’t lag as you use it. If other editors were this simple, then far fewer people would feel the need to download video trimming software.</p>
<h4 id="8-Kizoa-2"><a href="#8-Kizoa-2" class="headerlink" title="8.

It offers a great deal of functions that allow you to trim your videos and edit them in a variety of ways. The sad part is that this tool is very well presented on the website, but most of the tools are locked behind a paywall. They nag users to pay their one-time fee, or to join their premium membership.</p>
<p>If you are looking to trim your videos, then this is a good place for uploading and trimming 4K videos. It also allows you to share videos, and if you pay, then you can store RAW videos. The online movie editor and movie maker allow you to trim your videos frame-by-frame. This is perfect for people who need precision when they are trimming their videos. It is also the sort of tool that more advanced users may enjoy.</p>

<p>If you are struggling to figure out which online video trimmer is for you, then here is a list of the 10+ best free online video trimmers.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers-3"><a href="#Why-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers-3" class="headerlink" title="Why Free Online Video Trimmers?"></a>Why Free Online Video Trimmers?</h2><p>Why would anybody use free “Online” video trimmers when there are so many good offline (downloadable) trimmers a person can use? Windows even has its own installed video trimmer. Simply right click your video, navigate to “Open With” and then click on “Photos.” At the top right of the GUI is an icon called “Edit &amp; Create.” Click it and it takes you to the editing function where you may trim your video.</p>
<p>The sad part is that the pre-installed video editor for Windows is just like the one for Mac. It is slow to process, it is very basic, and it doesn’t allow you to edit frame-by-frame. As a result, most people prefer a free online video trimmer as opposed to a pre-installed tool or third-party video trimmer app.</p>
<h2 id="10-Best-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers-3"><a href="#10-Best-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers-3" class="headerlink" title="10+ Best Free Online Video Trimmers"></a>10+ Best Free Online Video Trimmers</h2><p>There are many reasons why online trimmers are preferred. Many times, the sorts of video trimmers one downloads are full of malware, bloatware, and ransomware. Even the ones that claim to be clean have suspicious obvious security holes.</p>
<p>Another common reason is that many online trimmers allow trimming and conversions in formats, file types, and resolutions that downloadable programs do not. Also, even the world’s best free downloadable video trimmer <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.blender.org/" >Blender.org <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, is so viciously complicated that one would need weeks of tutorials just to figure out how to use it.</p>
<p>In many cases, the simplest and most straight-forwards answer is to use an online trimmer. To quickly upload, trim, convert, maybe add effects, and then download. It is quicker, easier, and often runs a smaller risk of security breaches, ID theft, and malware problems.</p>
<p>So in this part, I review the 10+ best online video trimmers that are easy to use for beginners and those who just need a few of cuts. Among them on the top is video cutter from Wondershare.</p>

<p>The WonderShare Filmora program is littered with features you can use if you are willing to download its program and use it on your device. It has a free version that you can download, but what most people do not know is that it has a video trimmer online.</p>
<p>The <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >free online video trimmer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> allows you to upload a video, and then edit it within your web browser. Once your video is uploaded, you are able to edit and trim it in minutes. You may also change the output format. You may set the video trim using the manual tool that allows you to look at your video as it plays. Or, you may use the start and end function and simply enter the starting position and finishing position.</p>
<p>Exporting and downloading is very easy, and there is no obligation to buy one of their other tools. The odd thing is that most people do not know this service is even available. Most people think that the website is simply full of editing tools. Most are unaware there are any free online tools.</p>
<p>Just like many users known, Wondershare has a desktop video editor for Windows and Mac that is very easy and simple to use, named <strong>Filmora</strong>. it’s very powerful for beginners. You can download it for free now.</p>

<p>The name may be a little uninspired, but the video cutter is not a bad online tool. It is nestled in between a series of other simple online tools such as a voice recorder, file converter and so forth. You do not need to download this tool. You start by clicking the “Open File” button.</p>
<p>Pick the video you wish to trim, and then wait for it to upload. It takes a while to upload your video because the servers are not great. Once the video is uploaded, you are able to use the simple tools the website has to offer in order to trim your video.</p>
<p>There is a bit of advertising on the website, but mostly the web master is hoping for donations to keep the website running. Since the website doesn’t make much money, it cannot afford to pay for better bandwidth or better servers, which is why it sometimes takes quite a while to upload, trim, and then download. But, it is free, so it is difficult to complain.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular opinion, the YouTube video trimmer tools are pretty poor quality. But, they ride high on this list because of their amazing server speeds and storage capacity. There are plenty of video editors that will cut out if you try to upload larger files, but the YouTube Creator Studio will not.</p>
<p>YouTube has billions of dollars behind it because it is owned by Google. A common problem with online video trimmers is that they take too long to upload and download. That is still a problem with the YouTube system, but it is still one of the fastest uploading and downloading video tools on the Internet.</p>
<p>Another problem with other online trimmers is that it is difficult to upload large videos. Many online trimmers will freeze or crash, which means all the uploading was for nothing. But, the YouTube system will not crash or freeze. You simply leave your computer alone, and eventually it will upload your file (even large files). For these reasons, the YouTube Creator Studios tool rides pretty high up this list.</p>
<h4 id="5-Video-Toolbox-3"><a href="#5-Video-Toolbox-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Video Toolbox"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.videotoolbox.com/" >Video Toolbox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                ></p>
<p>The Video Toolbox system sits on a very cheaply made website that is pretty darn ugly. But, this tool reaches the number four position because it is rather more advanced than one has come to expect from a free video trimmer and editor.</p>
<p>The tool is free, and it can process video files of up to 1500MB, which is not a massive amount, but it is about the size of three episodes of the Simpsons. This tool can convert your video files to a wide range of other file types. You may also alter the bit rate, audio codec, video codex, frame rate, sample rate and channels.</p>
<p>This tool also comes with online features that allow you to re-download your previous videos, see your recent file outputs, and delete your log files. It is also able to pull items from your videos such as meta data, subtitle files, and so forth. Plus, the tool allows you to merge videos and crop videos with just a few clicks.</p>

                      alt="free online video trimmer"
                ></p>
<p>The WeVideo tool is an online editor. It is a video trimmer windows compatible program that will run off of your Edge web browser. The tool is pretty easy to use, it is fairly fast and flexible. The sad part is that this tool offers a series of seemingly perfect tool functions, but it asks for money for them.</p>
<p>For example, the video trimmer is free, but the green-screen tool is not. They always ask you to turn your free account into a paid account, which is very annoying. Yet, this tool reaches number five on this list because the GUI for the video trimmer is great, and the level of support for this system is pretty good too.</p>
<h4 id="7-Wincreator-Video-Cutter-3"><a href="#7-Wincreator-Video-Cutter-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Wincreator Video Cutter"></a>7. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.wincreator.com/video-cutter" >Wincreator Video Cutter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="free online video trimmer"
                ></p>
<p>This video editor is another video trimmer free service. The GUI is pretty ugly, but it is the sort of simple tool that gets to the point and gets there pretty quickly. The biggest downside is that the free video trimmer will only accept up to 50MB of data. This is not very much. It is the sort of amount you may upload to Instagram.</p>
<p>The tool is very lightweight, which means the pages are less likely to crash or freeze. It also means that the editor loads quickly and doesn’t lag as you use it. If other editors were this simple, then far fewer people would feel the need to download video trimming software.</p>
<h4 id="8-Kizoa-3"><a href="#8-Kizoa-3" class="headerlink" title="8.

It offers a great deal of functions that allow you to trim your videos and edit them in a variety of ways. The sad part is that this tool is very well presented on the website, but most of the tools are locked behind a paywall. They nag users to pay their one-time fee, or to join their premium membership.</p>
<p>If you are looking to trim your videos, then this is a good place for uploading and trimming 4K videos. It also allows you to share videos, and if you pay, then you can store RAW videos. The online movie editor and movie maker allow you to trim your videos frame-by-frame. This is perfect for people who need precision when they are trimming their videos. It is also the sort of tool that more advanced users may enjoy.</p>
<h4 id="9-Aconvert-Video-Cutter-3"><a href="#9-Aconvert-Video-Cutter-3" class="headerlink" title="9.

<p>This is possibly one of the simplest tools on this list, which is good in most cases, but some may need a little more in order to do a good job. There is however a function that offers a little more flexibility than other tools. Once your video is uploaded, you can choose a different output file from over ten different file types.</p>
<p>You can specify which part of the video you wish to cut prior to uploading. This saves a lot of processing time when the video is uploaded, which is probably going to suit people who have a lot of small videos to cut and who do not want to wait around for the website to respond. You are able to upload up to 200MB, which is not great, but it is also not terrible. It is around the size of four music videos, or a mobile-episode of a US sitcom.</p>
<h4 id="10-Clip-Champ-3"><a href="#10-Clip-Champ-3" class="headerlink" title="10. Clip Champ"></a>10. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://clipchamp.com/en/video-editor" >Clip Champ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="free online video trimmer"
                ></p>
<p>This tool has a very user-friendly interface. It has the sort of simple interface that beats out websites like SnapChat, WhatsApp and so forth. The website that hosts the tool says that you do not need experience to use their editing tools, and that is probably true. The biggest downside to this tool, and the reason it sits on the number nine spot, is that they will not let you use the tool without signing in.</p>
<p>It may not seem like such a big deal to have to sign into an account, but it is just for marketing purposes. It also allows them to sell you other services that they offer. If you are only looking to trim your videos, then there are far simpler ways to do it through the online trimmers listed in this article.</p>
<p>If you are looking for more of an online editor, then maybe you should consider the Clip Champ. Suffice it to say that this is not the best tool for quick and simple video trims because there are other tools listed on this article that are much faster.</p>

                      alt="free online video trimmer"
                ></p>
<p>This is a great tool with a fairly simple interface. You can see your videos as you trim them. And, you can edit your videos, gone their settings, add text, and so forth. Yet, it is only their simplest functions that are for free. The trimming function is free, but many of the editing tools are not.</p>
<p>This would not normally be a problem, but this website is always dangling its other products and its prices in front of you. If you are just looking to trim a file, then the adverts for their services can become annoying. The tool renders and works well on web browsers, so it may be of interest to people who are willing to pay for semi-professional editing tools.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-Which-Suits-You-the-Best-3"><a href="#Conclusion-Which-Suits-You-the-Best-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion - Which Suits You the Best?"></a>Conclusion - Which Suits You the Best?</h2><p>There are tools on this article for most types of trimming jobs. There are tools that will quickly upload and process your smaller videos, which is suitable for people making social media videos. Then, there are tools that will take a large and bulky file, and are good for people who are very conscious about the file output and video quality.</p>
<p>It is a pity that some of these tools ask for money to use their other editing services. But, if you want to trim your videos for free, then all of these tools on this article will help you.</p>

<p>If you are involved in video editing or post-production activities, then you might be familiar with color matching. In this, we make sure that the overall color and tone of our videos are matched throughout. Thankfully, you can easily do color match in Final Cut Pro or any other reliable video editing tool. In this detailed Final Cut Pro match color tutorial, I will help you do the same and would also share details about its best alternative.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Use-Final-Cut-Pro-X-to-Match-Colors-A-Stepwise-Guide"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Use-Final-Cut-Pro-X-to-Match-Colors-A-Stepwise-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Use Final Cut Pro X to Match Colors: A Stepwise Guide"></a>Part 1: How to Use Final Cut Pro X to Match Colors: A Stepwise Guide</h2><p>Final Cut Pro X has to be one of the most resourceful Mac applications that you can use to edit your videos. If you want, you can use the automatic FCPX match color tool in the application to automatically apply the effect. Besides that, you can manually match color in Final Cut Pro X by using its inbuilt features.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Using the Final Cut Pro Match Color Tool</strong></p>
<p>To use the Final Cut Pro X Match Color feature, you can simply go through these simple steps:</p>
<p><em>Step 1: Load and import the video clips</em></p>
<p>To begin with, you can just launch Final Cut Pro on your Mac and go to its File &gt; Import &gt; Media to load any video clip of your choice. You can simply drag and drop your videos to the Final Cut Pro interface.</p>
<p><em>Step 2: Apply the FCPX Match Color effect</em></p>
<p>Now, simply select the clip you want to edit, go to the Enhancement menu, and click on the Match Color icon (below the viewer). You can also find it under the Modify &gt; Match Color option or get the feature by pressing the Option + Command + M key combination.</p>
<p>Afterward, the Color Match FCPX tool will display two different screens in the viewer. On the right, you would have the clip from where you can match the source while the target clip will be displayed on the left.</p>
<p>From the Final Cut Pro timeline or the browser, you can find the appropriate clips. If you want, you can even import a still image to source the respective colors for matching. Simply preview the changes that the FCPX Color Match tool will make and click on the “Apply Match” in the end.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Adjust the Video Color Manually</strong></p>
<p>Apart from the match color tool in Final Cut, you can also manually set the color grading and saturation feature. While this will not get you instant or exact results to color match in Final Cut Pro, you can still give it a try.</p>
<p>Once the video clip is loaded on Filmora, just go to the Effects Browser &gt; Inspector and add the Color Correction effect to the video. Now, you can go to the Color Correction tab from the sidebar to manually adjust the value for color, saturation, and exposure to get the desired effects.</p>

Therefore, you can also take the assistance of <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It is a powerful video editing and post-production tool that is extremely easy to use and runs on all the major macOS versions.</p>
<ul>
<li>On Filmora, you can find seamless options like color matching, color tuning, splitting, resizing, scene detection, and so on.</li>
<li>There are also tons of advanced video editing features in Filmora like keyframing, motion detection, green screen edits, etc.</li>
<li>You can find a wide range of effects, presets, texts, stickers, transitions, and more in the Filmora library.</li>
<li>There are also dedicated options to edit audio in your media files or add voiceovers.</li>
<li>Filmora is one of the easiest video editing tools out there with import&#x2F;export options for all the leading formats.</li>
</ul>
<p>To perform automatic color matching in your videos using Wondershare Filmora, the following steps can be taken:</p>
<p><em>Step 1: Import the video to edit on Filmora</em></p>
<p>At first, you can just launch Filmora on your Mac and drag-and-drop the video you want to edit. You can also go to its File &gt; Import Media to load any video of your choice on Filmora and just drag the clips to the timeline (at the bottom).</p>
<p><em>Step 2: Apply Color Correction to your Clips</em></p>
<p>If you want, you can add multiple clips on Filmora and simply add them to the timeline as per your requirements.</p>
<p>You can now take the playhead and place it from where you wish to edit the video. You can select the remaining clip (or photos), right-click, and choose the Color Match option. Alternatively, you can also click on the color palette icon on the timeline’s toolbar and select the “Color Match” button.</p>
<p>This will change the viewer into two screens. Here, you can select the reference picture or clip as a source and preview its effects on the target clip. You can also go to the Color tab on the side and adjust its level under the Comparison View section.</p>
<p>On the viewer window, you can see all the changes, and click on the “Match” button to apply the effect.</p>
<p><em>Step 3: Export your video to a preferred format</em></p>
<p>After making the needed changes and applying the color correction feature, you can go to the Export option of the tool. Here, you can choose a preferred format to export your file and even choose its resolution and video quality.</p>
<p>I’m sure that after reading this post you would be able to apply color match in Final Cut Pro. As you can see, I have included a stepwise tutorial that anyone can follow to use the Final Cut Pro Match Color tool. Though, if you are looking for a better and more user-friendly option, then explore Wondershare Filmora. The free video editing application offers a wide range of features and will certainly meet every post-production need of yours in no time!</p>

<p>If you are involved in video editing or post-production activities, then you might be familiar with color matching. In this, we make sure that the overall color and tone of our videos are matched throughout. Thankfully, you can easily do color match in Final Cut Pro or any other reliable video editing tool. In this detailed Final Cut Pro match color tutorial, I will help you do the same and would also share details about its best alternative.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Use-Final-Cut-Pro-X-to-Match-Colors-A-Stepwise-Guide-1"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Use-Final-Cut-Pro-X-to-Match-Colors-A-Stepwise-Guide-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Use Final Cut Pro X to Match Colors: A Stepwise Guide"></a>Part 1: How to Use Final Cut Pro X to Match Colors: A Stepwise Guide</h2><p>Final Cut Pro X has to be one of the most resourceful Mac applications that you can use to edit your videos. If you want, you can use the automatic FCPX match color tool in the application to automatically apply the effect. Besides that, you can manually match color in Final Cut Pro X by using its inbuilt features.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Using the Final Cut Pro Match Color Tool</strong></p>
<p>To use the Final Cut Pro X Match Color feature, you can simply go through these simple steps:</p>
<p><em>Step 1: Load and import the video clips</em></p>
<p>To begin with, you can just launch Final Cut Pro on your Mac and go to its File &gt; Import &gt; Media to load any video clip of your choice. You can simply drag and drop your videos to the Final Cut Pro interface.</p>
<p><em>Step 2: Apply the FCPX Match Color effect</em></p>
<p>Now, simply select the clip you want to edit, go to the Enhancement menu, and click on the Match Color icon (below the viewer). You can also find it under the Modify &gt; Match Color option or get the feature by pressing the Option + Command + M key combination.</p>
<p>Afterward, the Color Match FCPX tool will display two different screens in the viewer. On the right, you would have the clip from where you can match the source while the target clip will be displayed on the left.</p>
<p>From the Final Cut Pro timeline or the browser, you can find the appropriate clips. If you want, you can even import a still image to source the respective colors for matching. Simply preview the changes that the FCPX Color Match tool will make and click on the “Apply Match” in the end.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Adjust the Video Color Manually</strong></p>
<p>Apart from the match color tool in Final Cut, you can also manually set the color grading and saturation feature. While this will not get you instant or exact results to color match in Final Cut Pro, you can still give it a try.</p>
<p>Once the video clip is loaded on Filmora, just go to the Effects Browser &gt; Inspector and add the Color Correction effect to the video. Now, you can go to the Color Correction tab from the sidebar to manually adjust the value for color, saturation, and exposure to get the desired effects.</p>

<p>In addition, you can add visual effects and stickers to your videos and if you decide to go live you’ll be able to use some of the live streaming filters.

<p>The app’s user-friendly interface makes it easy to create and discover music videos. Downloading Fideo Music Video Show will make you a part of the global community of music video makers, so you can become friends with like-minded people and follow their work. The process of making a music video with Fideo is straightforward since you only have to select a song from the app’s music library that contains thousands of sounds and songs and record the lip-sync video. The video editing features enable you to polish your videos in any way you want and share it with other Fideo users to get likes and comments.</p>
<p>Even though the app offers a decent amount of video editing options, it lacks the cool visual effects, apps like TikTok Including Musical.ly or Video Star offer. What’s more, Fideo’s file sharing options are limited as you can’t share your videos on other social media networks.</p>
