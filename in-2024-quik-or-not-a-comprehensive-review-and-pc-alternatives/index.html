A few highlighting features are discussed below:</p>
<h3 id="1-Create-Amazing-Videos-In-Just-A-Few-Clicks"><a href="#1-Create-Amazing-Videos-In-Just-A-Few-Clicks" class="headerlink" title="1.Create Amazing Videos In Just A Few Clicks"></a>1.Create Amazing Videos In Just A Few Clicks</h3><p>With GoPro Quik, making amazing videos is very easy.

But for this feature to work, make sure that you have an active GoPro PLUS subscription.</p>
<h3 id="3-Excellent-editing"><a href="#3-Excellent-editing" class="headerlink" title="3.Excellent editing"></a>3.Excellent editing</h3><p>Simply click a few buttons to turn GoPro footage into an awesome video.

Make a unique video from your burst and timelapse photos. Additionally, you can find and save the most memorable moments in a video, then share them as high-quality still images.</p>

<h2 id="Final-Verdict"><a href="#Final-Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a>Final Verdict</h2><p>Although GoPro Quik is amazing and comes with a lot of features, there are still many limitations of this application, as discussed in the cons section of this article. If you want to do basic editing, then this app will do just good, but if you are looking for advanced features like audio normalization, keyframing, color tuning, gif support, etc., then you will have to use another fully-fledged video editing app. We recommend you to give a try to our <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> video editor.</p>

<h2 id="Apple-Apps-for-Video-Editing-You-Should-Try"><a href="#Apple-Apps-for-Video-Editing-You-Should-Try" class="headerlink" title="Apple Apps for Video Editing You Should Try"></a>Apple Apps for Video Editing You Should Try</h2><p>In today’s world, photos and videos are an integral part of everyone’s life. Mobile phones, laptops, and cameras may all be used to capture them. But, it might not be easy to organize and decorate them according to one’s unique preferences. Fortunately, there are several tools available to help Apple users with these tasks.</p>
<p>In the following part, I will introduce 5 best apple video editing software, including its unique features listed.</p>
<h3 id="1-Photos"><a href="#1-Photos" class="headerlink" title="1. Photos"></a>1. Photos</h3><p><strong>Supported By:</strong> iOS&#x2F;macOS&#x2F;iPadOS</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free to use</p>
<p>The number one on our list is the Photos app. It’s among the most well-known application for video editing enthusiasts in the iOS community. This is an application mostly used by professional designers and developers who are into the video editing profession.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with Photos App?</strong></p>
<p>Apple Inc. created Photos, a picture storage and editing program. Its main features are its simplicity and ease of usage. Its very name is a lovely and obvious indication of its use. Since 2015, this Mac picture editing app has been offered for OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 and tvOS v.10.</p>
<p>Filters and Smart Sliders are among the editing tools available in this program. It also has the Mark-up tool that allows you to <strong>add text</strong>, shapes, and doodles, as well as signatures. What’s more, you can <strong>rotate, crop and auto enhance</strong> videos in this app as well. Like photos editing, if you are not satisfied with the editing, you can tap <strong>Revert</strong> to restore to the original version.</p>
<p>If you are using the Photos app on iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro, you can <strong>adjust the focus points and the depth of the field</strong> in Cinematic mode to make a cinematic-looking video easily.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edit Videos Anywhere with iCloud Photo Library</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The connection with iCloud Picture Library is where Photos outperforms every other Mac image editing tool. This fantastic feature allows users to fill out their libraries rather than their devices. This is accomplished by syncing photographs and videos across all Apple devices, including the iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, MacBook and Apple Watch.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Moments</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Photos employs Moments as an organizer, which may be used to build categories and years. Moments are a mix of the photo’s time and location information. Furthermore, facial recognition enables users to create groups based on a person, among other things.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Themes</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Themes, which allow users to make calendars, picture albums, and other projects, complement the modifying and organizing capabilities. The program also provides printing capabilities for professional results.</p>
<h3 id="2-QuickTime-Player"><a href="#2-QuickTime-Player" class="headerlink" title="2. QuickTime Player"></a>2. QuickTime Player</h3><p><strong>Supported By:</strong> iOS&#x2F;macOS&#x2F;iPad</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free to use</p>
<p>Next on our list is the QuickTime Player that lets you do almost whatever you want to do with your videos and pictures. The app is built to support both beginners and professionals. However, we would lean more towards beginners because most professionals today prefer apps like iMovie or Final Cut Pro. But that’s not to say this one doesn’t have excellent features to offer.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with QuickTime Player App?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trim, Combine,</strong> <strong>Rotate, Split MOV Video</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone wants to make their lengthy videos short. QuickTime allows you to do precisely that with its trimming feature. Make your videos short and catchy with this feature. Further, you can combine two videos to make one excellent video for your presentation. The app also allows you to split different videos and combine them to produce more quality content.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Record Screen and Voiceover</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you think your video footage can do well with a background voiceover of someone else, QuickTime Player allows you to record your audios in the background while your video plays smoothly. You can also record the desktop screen with the Player.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Shrink Video</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you believe your video looks better with a small size in appearance, try shrinking it using the shrink feature in the QuickTime Player. You can lower the video quality from 1080p, 720p to whatever your phone or Mac storage deems compatible.</p>
<h3 id="3-Clips"><a href="#3-Clips" class="headerlink" title="3. Clips"></a>3. Clips</h3><p><strong>Supported By:</strong> iOS&#x2F;iPad</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free to Use</p>
<p>You might not have heard of Clips as much as you may have heard about the others on this list. But don’t sleep on this one. Clips have slowly but surely gained the attraction of expert video editors, and you’d see almost all of them having Clips on their iPhones or Macs.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with Clips?</strong></p>
<p>Apple Clips is interesting to check out when you’re an iOS fan. You can use this free video editing app to record and edit 16:9, 4:3 or square videos with various camera effects, stunning filters, animated text, music, emoji, stickers, and more, and then share it with your friends or family.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Family-Oriented</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Apple Clips is mainly oriented towards families and children, and it isn’t even close to the capabilities of iMovie. Nonetheless, it is moving closer to be a genuine video editing program with each new version.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AR Spaces</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Apple Clips, for instance, introduced AR Spaces, an augmented reality function for iPhone 12 Pro and iPad Pro owners, in April.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cinematic Mode</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, the most recent version in September enables you to import and edit video shot in Cinematic mode on the iPhone 13 and ProRes footage from the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max.</p>
<h3 id="4-iMovie"><a href="#4-iMovie" class="headerlink" title="4. iMovie"></a>4. iMovie</h3><p><strong>Supported By:</strong> iOS&#x2F;iPadOS&#x2F;macOS</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free to use</p>
<p>One of the most recognizable apps in the Apple market for video editing software is the iMovie app. Almost all professional experts are reaping the benefits of using the iMovie app. The app developers have emphasized greatly equipping the professionals and the newbies who so desperately want to make their mark into the video editing profession.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with iMovie?</strong></p>
<p>iMovie, is more like Final Cut Pro X’s younger sibling. But it’s free with your Mac, so there’s no danger in giving it a shot. It’s an excellent option for newcomers learning to use editing software, casual enthusiasts, and even YouTubers who wish to cut up their films.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Merge, Cut, Trim: Pull off Everything!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Although iMovie is rather simple, this may be considered a benefit for inexperienced editors. You can combine, cut, and rearrange your original video and audio with iMovie.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>4K Video Editing</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You may even export your work in 4K quality at up to 60 frames per second once you’ve done it. Many effects, transitions, filters, and fine-tuning settings for white balance, color matching, and audio isolation are also included.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cinematic Mode</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In September, iMovie received a major upgrade, which included importing and editing footage taken in Cinematic mode on the iPhone 13 to Macs. You may now add, tweak, and delete focus points, as well as change the depths of field effect in a video shot in Cinematic mode, assuming you have a modern iPhone or iPad.</p>

Once you know what you want to accomplish you should <strong>acquire as much information as you possibly can about a video editing software</strong> in order to find out if the video editor you’re considering can help you accomplish your goal. The <strong>price</strong> is yet another factor you should consider since you don’t have to spend a lot of money on video editing software that takes years to master if you just want to create a promotional video for your company.</p>
<p>Besides the features, a video editing application offers, you should also <strong>try to find out how user-friendly its interface is</strong> and how <strong>comfortable or efficient</strong> you are while working on a project in a video editing software. <strong>Installing a trial version</strong> of a video editor might help you decide if that editor is the right choice for you. If you have absolutely no previous video editing experience, then it is best to start with a simple video editing app like iMovie or the Photos App and then switch to a more advanced video editor once you develop your video editing skills.</p>

<p>The popularity of video content on social media networks has been soaring in the last couple of years, and it is only reasonable to expect this trend to continue. Tutorials, promotional videos and various other types of videos for social media help companies run successful advertising campaigns and increase their profits. You don’t have to be a seasoned video editing professional in order to create videos for social networks, in fact, you can make viral videos even with entry-level video editing software, like iMovie or Avidemux. That’s the reason why in this article we are going to introduce you to 10+ best video editing apps you can use online, on Mac and PC computers or Smartphones.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Video-Editing-Software-for-Novice-Video-Content-Creators-in-2024-2"><a href="#Best-Video-Editing-Software-for-Novice-Video-Content-Creators-in-2024-2" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Editing Software for Novice Video Content Creators in 2024"></a>Best Video Editing Software for Novice Video Content Creators in 2024</h2><p>Anyone who has access to a computer that runs on a macOS or Windows OS can edit videos for free because both of these operating systems have built-in video editing software. Let’s take a look at the free video editing options Mac and PC users have at their disposal in 2024.</p>
<h4 id="1-iMovie-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-macOS-and-iOS-2"><a href="#1-iMovie-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-macOS-and-iOS-2" class="headerlink" title="1. iMovie –Best Free Video Editing Software for Beginners on macOS and iOS"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/imovie/" >iMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> –Best Free Video Editing Software for Beginners on macOS and iOS</h4><p>Learning how to use iMovie to create videos for social media won’t take too much of your time, as the app’s intuitive interface makes performing all basic video editing actions look easy. iMovie lets you edit footage recorded in resolutions up to 4K and it features 10 high fidelity filters that enhance the colors in your videos. The app also lets you create PIP and split screen videos, alter the playback speed of a video clip or create engaging opening titles or end credits. The royalty-free music, sound effects or the voiceover recording feature can all help you create a perfect soundtrack for each video you edit in iMovie.</p>
<h4 id="2-Photos-App-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-Windows-10-2"><a href="#2-Photos-App-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-Windows-10-2" class="headerlink" title="2.

The app’s Edit&amp;Create menu offers Draw, Add slo-mo or Trim tools that allow you to draw over the source footage and remove unwanted pieces of video clips from the timeline. The Photos App is equipped with a number of 3D effects and a rich collection of filters that can assist you in creating a distinctive visual style for each new video you edit with it. However, the app’s exporting options are far from impressive, since you can’t export your projects to social media directly from the Photos App.</p>

Windows Movie Maker grants you access to a huge collection of transitions and visual effects and it makes the process of creating titles effortless. Certain options like video stabilization are only available on the version of the video editing software that is compatible with Windows 8, and the exact list of the tools provided by Windows Movie Maker varies on different versions of the Windows OS.</p>

This open source video editor is compatible with Linux, macOS and Windows OS, which means that you can edit videos with it regardless of the computer you have. Avidemux supports nearly all video file formats, and it is a perfect choice for all video content creators who frequently shoot their videos on different cameras. Nonetheless, the number of video editing tools Avidemux offers is far from impressive which limits your options during the video editing process.</p>

If you have absolutely no previous video editing experience, then it is best to start with a simple video editing app like iMovie or the Photos App and then switch to a more advanced video editor once you develop your video editing skills.</p>

<p>The popularity of video content on social media networks has been soaring in the last couple of years, and it is only reasonable to expect this trend to continue. Tutorials, promotional videos and various other types of videos for social media help companies run successful advertising campaigns and increase their profits. You don’t have to be a seasoned video editing professional in order to create videos for social networks, in fact, you can make viral videos even with entry-level video editing software, like iMovie or Avidemux. That’s the reason why in this article we are going to introduce you to 10+ best video editing apps you can use online, on Mac and PC computers or Smartphones.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Video-Editing-Software-for-Novice-Video-Content-Creators-in-2024-3"><a href="#Best-Video-Editing-Software-for-Novice-Video-Content-Creators-in-2024-3" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Editing Software for Novice Video Content Creators in 2024"></a>Best Video Editing Software for Novice Video Content Creators in 2024</h2><p>Anyone who has access to a computer that runs on a macOS or Windows OS can edit videos for free because both of these operating systems have built-in video editing software. Let’s take a look at the free video editing options Mac and PC users have at their disposal in 2024.</p>
<h4 id="1-iMovie-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-macOS-and-iOS-3"><a href="#1-iMovie-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-macOS-and-iOS-3" class="headerlink" title="1. iMovie –Best Free Video Editing Software for Beginners on macOS and iOS"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/imovie/" >iMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> –Best Free Video Editing Software for Beginners on macOS and iOS</h4><p>Learning how to use iMovie to create videos for social media won’t take too much of your time, as the app’s intuitive interface makes performing all basic video editing actions look easy. iMovie lets you edit footage recorded in resolutions up to 4K and it features 10 high fidelity filters that enhance the colors in your videos. The app also lets you create PIP and split screen videos, alter the playback speed of a video clip or create engaging opening titles or end credits. The royalty-free music, sound effects or the voiceover recording feature can all help you create a perfect soundtrack for each video you edit in iMovie.</p>
<h4 id="2-Photos-App-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-Windows-10-3"><a href="#2-Photos-App-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-Windows-10-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Photos App –Best Free Video Editing Software for Beginners on Windows 10"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-photos/9wzdncrfjbh4?activetab=pivot:overviewtab" >Photos App <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> –Best Free Video Editing Software for Beginners on Windows 10</h4><p>Even though the Photos App doesn’t offer a lot of video editing options you can still use it to process the footage you recorded before sharing it online. The app’s Edit&amp;Create menu offers Draw, Add slo-mo or Trim tools that allow you to draw over the source footage and remove unwanted pieces of video clips from the timeline. The Photos App is equipped with a number of 3D effects and a rich collection of filters that can assist you in creating a distinctive visual style for each new video you edit with it. However, the app’s exporting options are far from impressive, since you can’t export your projects to social media directly from the Photos App.</p>
<h4 id="3-Windows-Movie-Maker-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-Windows-8-7-3"><a href="#3-Windows-Movie-Maker-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-Windows-8-7-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Windows Movie Maker –Best Free Video Editing Software for Beginners on Windows 8&#x2F;7"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Windows Movie Maker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> –Best Free Video Editing Software for Beginners on Windows 8&#x2F;7</h4><p>It’s already been a couple of years since the Windows Movie Maker was discontinued, but despite that this video editing software remains one of the best options for novice video editors who are still using Windows 8 or older versions of the Windows OS. Windows Movie Maker grants you access to a huge collection of transitions and visual effects and it makes the process of creating titles effortless. Certain options like video stabilization are only available on the version of the video editing software that is compatible with Windows 8, and the exact list of the tools provided by Windows Movie Maker varies on different versions of the Windows OS.</p>
<h4 id="4-Avidemux-–Best-Free-Open-Source-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-in-2020-3"><a href="#4-Avidemux-–Best-Free-Open-Source-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-in-2020-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Avidemux –Best Free Open Source Video Editing Software for Beginners in 2020"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://avidemux.sourceforge.net/" >Avidemux <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> –Best Free Open Source Video Editing Software for Beginners in 2020</h4><p>Transcoding video files or automating video editing tasks is the most common reason why inexperienced video editors opt for Avidemux. This open source video editor is compatible with Linux, macOS and Windows OS, which means that you can edit videos with it regardless of the computer you have. Avidemux supports nearly all video file formats, and it is a perfect choice for all video content creators who frequently shoot their videos on different cameras. Nonetheless, the number of video editing tools Avidemux offers is far from impressive which limits your options during the video editing process.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Cheap-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-in-2020-3"><a href="#Best-Cheap-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-in-2020-3" class="headerlink" title="Best Cheap Video Editing Software for Beginners in 2020"></a>Best Cheap Video Editing Software for Beginners in 2020</h2><p>Creating professional-looking videos with free video editing software products is a challenging task even for an experienced video editor. So, instead of struggling to make visually impactful content with free video editing apps you can purchase the license to use video editors that offer an abundance of video editing tools. Here are some of the least expensive options on the market.</p>
<h4 id="5-Wondershare-Filmii-3"><a href="#5-Wondershare-Filmii-3" class="headerlink" title="5.

<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmii/article-images/filmii-in-filmora-960-250.png" >Wondershare Filmii <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://filmii.wondershare.com/?utm_source=other_media_sites&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=f9_article_banner&utm_content=link_fm_fm_en_19063351_2020-11-25" >https://filmii.wondershare.com/?utm%5Fsource=other%5Fmedia%5Fsites&amp;utm%5Fmedium=banner&amp;utm%5Fcampaign=f9%5Farticle%5Fbanner&amp;utm%5Fcontent=link%5Ffm%5Ffm%5Fen%5F19063351%5F2020-11-25 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p>
<p>Creating videos with Filmii is easy. After launch the software, select a template from the start screen first and then import your images and footage to the timeline. Click the Auto Create button, and Filmii will automatically generate a video with text&#x2F;transitions&#x2F;music and effects. Want to personalize the auto-created video? Click the Advanced editing button and then you can customize the video with more flexibilities.</p>

<p>Each new version of Wondershare’s Filmora that was released in the last five years has expanded the software’s capabilities. Filmora is no exception since the app’s latest upgrade brings more than a few improvements that make the video editing process smoother.

Filmora simplifies the video editing process and allows you to enhance the colors in a video clip, create split screen and PIP effects or perform countless other video editing tasks in just a couple of clicks.</p>
