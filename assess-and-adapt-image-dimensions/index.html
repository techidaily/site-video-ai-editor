            <h2 id="Assess-and-Adapt-Image-Dimensions"><a href="#Assess-and-Adapt-Image-Dimensions" class="headerlink" title="Assess and Adapt Image Dimensions"></a>Assess and Adapt Image Dimensions</h2><p>You might have noticed that earlier DVDs came with full screen or widescreen viewing choices. Moreover, when you choose the wrong option, it cuts off the movie parts, or the video gets surrounded by black padding.</p>
<p>The standard resolution of your screen stretched from a 4:3 aspect ratio to the wider one. So, producers started making movies that fit on both screens. After the standardization of aspect ratio display, broadcasters pay attention to the image ratio of clips.</p>
<p>So, below is the guide to find, calculate and adjust image ratio with a picture ratio calculator. Let’s get started.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What is the image ratio?](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [Where Can I Find the Image ratio?](#Part 2)</p>
<p>03 [How to adjust image ratio](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-image-ratio"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-image-ratio" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is the image ratio?"></a>Part 1 What is the image ratio?</h2><p>The image or aspect ratio is the ratio of width to the height of a picture without any pixels attached. It is expressed with two a colon that separates two numbers, for example, 16:9.</p>
<p>In cinematography, common image ratios are 1.85:1 and 2.39:1, and in TV photography, it is 4:3 and 16:9. However, in still photography, the standard aspect ratio is 3:2.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Where-Can-I-Find-the-Image-ratio"><a href="#Part-2-Where-Can-I-Find-the-Image-ratio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Where Can I Find the Image ratio?"></a>Part 2 Where Can I Find the Image ratio?</h2><p>To select the right photo print size, you must consider the photo ratio and the print ratio. You can not accidentally choose the balance that needs cropping from the sides of the photo.</p>
<p>So, first, you must know how or where you can find the image ratio. The following are the methods to do so:</p>
<h3 id="Method-1-Check-your-Camera"><a href="#Method-1-Check-your-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Check your Camera"></a>Method 1: Check your Camera</h3><p>The image ratio depends directly on the camera’s sensor. You can find the correct balance for photo print based on your camera type. For example, APS-C and Full-frame cameras shoot in a 3:2 ratio. But compact cameras often shoot in a 4:3 ratio.</p>
<p>The photos that you click with your smartphones have a 16:9 or 4:3 ratio. The picture below shows some common photo ratios by type of camera and where it will look great in the home.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="Method-2-Find-Image-Information"><a href="#Method-2-Find-Image-Information" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Find Image Information"></a>Method 2: Find Image Information</h3><p>Unlike the photo ratios, image information determines the original width and height of the image in pixels. You can measure the picture dimensions in any unit, but you will always see the web or digital images in pixels.</p>
<p>Always remember that two different pictures with the same image ratio may not have the same dimensions. For example, a picture with size 1920X1080 pixels and a photo with size 1280x720 pixels can both have a 16:9 aspect ratio.</p>
<h3 id="Method-3-Check-with-Photoshop"><a href="#Method-3-Check-with-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Check with Photoshop"></a>Method 3: Check with Photoshop</h3><p>You can quickly check the image ratio in Photoshop (picture ratio calculator) using a crop tool. To do so, follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Open the image in Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Choose a crop tool.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Select the photo ratio.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Test different image ratios. You can begin with the standard ratios like 3:2, 16:9, 4:3, or 5:4.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If the crop frame captures the whole picture, it means you have already found the correct ratio.</p>
<p>Do you want a photo print in panorama or square shape? If yes, crop the picture to make it fit a different image ratio. For instance, edit the photo to fit a 1:1 ratio for a square shape.</p>
<p>Or crop a picture to 2:1. 3:1. 4:1, 5:1, or 6:1 ratio for a panorama photo.</p>

<h3 id="Method-4-Image-Ratio-Calculation"><a href="#Method-4-Image-Ratio-Calculation" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Image Ratio Calculation"></a>Method 4: Image Ratio Calculation</h3><p>You can find the image ratio using the resolution of a photo easily on a window’s system. To do so, right-click on an image file and scroll down to the Properties. Under details, you will notice, size of a photo in pixels.</p>
<p>To calculate the photo ratio, divide the width by the height of an image. If the total is an integer, multiply it by other numbers. These numbers are photo ratios.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Photo is 4966px by 3312px</p>

<p>03 [How to adjust image ratio](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-image-ratio-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-image-ratio-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is the image ratio?"></a>Part 1 What is the image ratio?</h2><p>The image or aspect ratio is the ratio of width to the height of a picture without any pixels attached. It is expressed with two a colon that separates two numbers, for example, 16:9.</p>
<p>In cinematography, common image ratios are 1.85:1 and 2.39:1, and in TV photography, it is 4:3 and 16:9. However, in still photography, the standard aspect ratio is 3:2.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Where-Can-I-Find-the-Image-ratio-1"><a href="#Part-2-Where-Can-I-Find-the-Image-ratio-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Where Can I Find the Image ratio?"></a>Part 2 Where Can I Find the Image ratio?</h2><p>To select the right photo print size, you must consider the photo ratio and the print ratio. You can not accidentally choose the balance that needs cropping from the sides of the photo.</p>
<p>So, first, you must know how or where you can find the image ratio. The following are the methods to do so:</p>
<h3 id="Method-1-Check-your-Camera-1"><a href="#Method-1-Check-your-Camera-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Check your Camera"></a>Method 1: Check your Camera</h3><p>The image ratio depends directly on the camera’s sensor. You can find the correct balance for photo print based on your camera type. For example, APS-C and Full-frame cameras shoot in a 3:2 ratio. But compact cameras often shoot in a 4:3 ratio.</p>
<p>The photos that you click with your smartphones have a 16:9 or 4:3 ratio. The picture below shows some common photo ratios by type of camera and where it will look great in the home.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<h3 id="Method-2-Find-Image-Information-1"><a href="#Method-2-Find-Image-Information-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Find Image Information"></a>Method 2: Find Image Information</h3><p>Unlike the photo ratios, image information determines the original width and height of the image in pixels. You can measure the picture dimensions in any unit, but you will always see the web or digital images in pixels.</p>
<p>Always remember that two different pictures with the same image ratio may not have the same dimensions. For example, a picture with size 1920X1080 pixels and a photo with size 1280x720 pixels can both have a 16:9 aspect ratio.</p>
<h3 id="Method-3-Check-with-Photoshop-1"><a href="#Method-3-Check-with-Photoshop-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Check with Photoshop"></a>Method 3: Check with Photoshop</h3><p>You can quickly check the image ratio in Photoshop (picture ratio calculator) using a crop tool. To do so, follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Open the image in Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Choose a crop tool.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Select the photo ratio.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Test different image ratios. You can begin with the standard ratios like 3:2, 16:9, 4:3, or 5:4.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If the crop frame captures the whole picture, it means you have already found the correct ratio.</p>
<p>Do you want a photo print in panorama or square shape? If yes, crop the picture to make it fit a different image ratio. For instance, edit the photo to fit a 1:1 ratio for a square shape.</p>
<p>Or crop a picture to 2:1. 3:1. 4:1, 5:1, or 6:1 ratio for a panorama photo.</p>

To do so, right-click on an image file and scroll down to the Properties. Under details, you will notice, size of a photo in pixels.</p>
<p>To calculate the photo ratio, divide the width by the height of an image. If the total is an integer, multiply it by other numbers. These numbers are photo ratios.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Photo is 4966px by 3312px</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Divide 4966 by 3312&#x3D; 1.5</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now, multiply 1.5 with 2 to obtain a whole number (1.5 X 2&#x3D; 3)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The photo’s ratio is 3:2</p>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Photo is 4416 x 3312 px</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Divide 4416 by 3312&#x3D; 1.3</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Multiply 1.3 with 3 to obtain a whole number(1.3 x 3&#x3D; 3.9 or approx. 4)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The photo’s ratio is 4:3</p>

<p>02 [Where Can I Find the Image ratio?](#Part 2)</p>
<p>03 [How to adjust image ratio](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-image-ratio-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-image-ratio-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is the image ratio?"></a>Part 1 What is the image ratio?</h2><p>The image or aspect ratio is the ratio of width to the height of a picture without any pixels attached. It is expressed with two a colon that separates two numbers, for example, 16:9.</p>
<p>In cinematography, common image ratios are 1.85:1 and 2.39:1, and in TV photography, it is 4:3 and 16:9. However, in still photography, the standard aspect ratio is 3:2.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Where-Can-I-Find-the-Image-ratio-2"><a href="#Part-2-Where-Can-I-Find-the-Image-ratio-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Where Can I Find the Image ratio?"></a>Part 2 Where Can I Find the Image ratio?</h2><p>To select the right photo print size, you must consider the photo ratio and the print ratio. You can not accidentally choose the balance that needs cropping from the sides of the photo.</p>
<p>So, first, you must know how or where you can find the image ratio. The following are the methods to do so:</p>
<h3 id="Method-1-Check-your-Camera-2"><a href="#Method-1-Check-your-Camera-2" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Check your Camera"></a>Method 1: Check your Camera</h3><p>The image ratio depends directly on the camera’s sensor. You can find the correct balance for photo print based on your camera type. For example, APS-C and Full-frame cameras shoot in a 3:2 ratio. But compact cameras often shoot in a 4:3 ratio.</p>
<p>The photos that you click with your smartphones have a 16:9 or 4:3 ratio. The picture below shows some common photo ratios by type of camera and where it will look great in the home.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="Method-2-Find-Image-Information-2"><a href="#Method-2-Find-Image-Information-2" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Find Image Information"></a>Method 2: Find Image Information</h3><p>Unlike the photo ratios, image information determines the original width and height of the image in pixels. You can measure the picture dimensions in any unit, but you will always see the web or digital images in pixels.</p>
<p>Always remember that two different pictures with the same image ratio may not have the same dimensions. For example, a picture with size 1920X1080 pixels and a photo with size 1280x720 pixels can both have a 16:9 aspect ratio.</p>
<h3 id="Method-3-Check-with-Photoshop-2"><a href="#Method-3-Check-with-Photoshop-2" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Check with Photoshop"></a>Method 3: Check with Photoshop</h3><p>You can quickly check the image ratio in Photoshop (picture ratio calculator) using a crop tool. To do so, follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Open the image in Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Choose a crop tool.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Select the photo ratio.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Test different image ratios. You can begin with the standard ratios like 3:2, 16:9, 4:3, or 5:4.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If the crop frame captures the whole picture, it means you have already found the correct ratio.</p>
<p>Do you want a photo print in panorama or square shape? If yes, crop the picture to make it fit a different image ratio. For instance, edit the photo to fit a 1:1 ratio for a square shape.</p>
<p>Or crop a picture to 2:1. 3:1. 4:1, 5:1, or 6:1 ratio for a panorama photo.</p>

<h3 id="Method-4-Image-Ratio-Calculation-2"><a href="#Method-4-Image-Ratio-Calculation-2" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Image Ratio Calculation"></a>Method 4: Image Ratio Calculation</h3><p>You can find the image ratio using the resolution of a photo easily on a window’s system. To do so, right-click on an image file and scroll down to the Properties. Under details, you will notice, size of a photo in pixels.</p>
<p>To calculate the photo ratio, divide the width by the height of an image. If the total is an integer, multiply it by other numbers. These numbers are photo ratios.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Photo is 4966px by 3312px</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Divide 4966 by 3312&#x3D; 1.5</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now, multiply 1.5 with 2 to obtain a whole number (1.5 X 2&#x3D; 3)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The photo’s ratio is 3:2</p>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Photo is 4416 x 3312 px</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Divide 4416 by 3312&#x3D; 1.3</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Multiply 1.3 with 3 to obtain a whole number(1.3 x 3&#x3D; 3.9 or approx. 4)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The photo’s ratio is 4:3</p>

But adjusting the video aspect ratio is more critical. Therefore, if you are a video editor, you must know how to do it. There are plenty of options to adjust the aspect ratio, and one of them is to use a photo aspect ratio calculator.</p>
<p>If you want to make permanent adjustments, use a convertor or editor. “Wondershare Filmora” is the best video editor that allows you to create videos with different aspect ratios and adjust these ratios easily.</p>

<p>02 [Where Can I Find the Image ratio?](#Part 2)</p>
<p>03 [How to adjust image ratio](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-image-ratio-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-image-ratio-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is the image ratio?"></a>Part 1 What is the image ratio?</h2><p>The image or aspect ratio is the ratio of width to the height of a picture without any pixels attached. It is expressed with two a colon that separates two numbers, for example, 16:9.</p>
<p>In cinematography, common image ratios are 1.85:1 and 2.39:1, and in TV photography, it is 4:3 and 16:9. However, in still photography, the standard aspect ratio is 3:2.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Where-Can-I-Find-the-Image-ratio-3"><a href="#Part-2-Where-Can-I-Find-the-Image-ratio-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Where Can I Find the Image ratio?"></a>Part 2 Where Can I Find the Image ratio?</h2><p>To select the right photo print size, you must consider the photo ratio and the print ratio. You can not accidentally choose the balance that needs cropping from the sides of the photo.</p>
<p>So, first, you must know how or where you can find the image ratio. The following are the methods to do so:</p>
<h3 id="Method-1-Check-your-Camera-3"><a href="#Method-1-Check-your-Camera-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Check your Camera"></a>Method 1: Check your Camera</h3><p>The image ratio depends directly on the camera’s sensor. You can find the correct balance for photo print based on your camera type. For example, APS-C and Full-frame cameras shoot in a 3:2 ratio. But compact cameras often shoot in a 4:3 ratio.</p>
<p>The photos that you click with your smartphones have a 16:9 or 4:3 ratio. The picture below shows some common photo ratios by type of camera and where it will look great in the home.</p>

<h3 id="Method-2-Find-Image-Information-3"><a href="#Method-2-Find-Image-Information-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Find Image Information"></a>Method 2: Find Image Information</h3><p>Unlike the photo ratios, image information determines the original width and height of the image in pixels. You can measure the picture dimensions in any unit, but you will always see the web or digital images in pixels.</p>
<p>Always remember that two different pictures with the same image ratio may not have the same dimensions. For example, a picture with size 1920X1080 pixels and a photo with size 1280x720 pixels can both have a 16:9 aspect ratio.</p>
<h3 id="Method-3-Check-with-Photoshop-3"><a href="#Method-3-Check-with-Photoshop-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Check with Photoshop"></a>Method 3: Check with Photoshop</h3><p>You can quickly check the image ratio in Photoshop (picture ratio calculator) using a crop tool. To do so, follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Open the image in Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Choose a crop tool.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Select the photo ratio.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Test different image ratios. You can begin with the standard ratios like 3:2, 16:9, 4:3, or 5:4.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If the crop frame captures the whole picture, it means you have already found the correct ratio.</p>
<p>Do you want a photo print in panorama or square shape? If yes, crop the picture to make it fit a different image ratio. For instance, edit the photo to fit a 1:1 ratio for a square shape.</p>
<p>Or crop a picture to 2:1. 3:1. 4:1, 5:1, or 6:1 ratio for a panorama photo.</p>

To do so, right-click on an image file and scroll down to the Properties. Under details, you will notice, size of a photo in pixels.</p>
<p>To calculate the photo ratio, divide the width by the height of an image. If the total is an integer, multiply it by other numbers. These numbers are photo ratios.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Photo is 4966px by 3312px</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Divide 4966 by 3312&#x3D; 1.5</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now, multiply 1.5 with 2 to obtain a whole number (1.5 X 2&#x3D; 3)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The photo’s ratio is 3:2</p>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Photo is 4416 x 3312 px</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Divide 4416 by 3312&#x3D; 1.3</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Multiply 1.3 with 3 to obtain a whole number(1.3 x 3&#x3D; 3.9 or approx. 4)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The photo’s ratio is 4:3</p>

                ></p>
<p>1. The Social Network (2010)</p>
<p>Based on the rise of the phenomenon that we now know as Facebook, The Social Network starred Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake. The movie performed well at the box office and was also positively received by movie critics.</p>
<p>The film won an Academy Award for Best Editing, collected by Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall. They used Final Cut Pro to edit the film, and one of the things they really like about the software is the ability to do multiple timelines. Final Cut Pro was also used in this movie to enable face replacement in a number of scenes. Two of the key characters in the movie are twins, and so the scenes were filmed with actors (who weren’t twins) and then the editing software was used to create the illusion that they were twins. Digital matte paintings was another feature of this movie that relied on the functionality of Final Cut Pro.</p>

                      alt="Movie made by FCP - The girl with dragon tattoo"
                ></p>
<p>2. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)</p>
<p>This was the US adaptation of the earlier Swedish film of the same name - based on the novel by Stieg Larsson. Starring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, the story is a crime thriller trying to uncover the secrets surrounding the disappearance of a young girl from a wealthy family.</p>
<p>One of the challenges with this movie was that there were a lot of invisible effects throughout the film. Final Cut Pro was used to achieve the shot stabilization and the visual enhancements - everything from matte painting to creating seasonal elements such as snow.</p>

                ></p>
<p>3. John Carter (2011)</p>
<p>A science fiction adventure, this film performed so badly at the box office that it caused major financial problems for its studio Disney.</p>
<p>The editing of the John Carter movie was a particular challenge as a lot of the action was shot twice during the troubled production. The editor Eric Zumbrunnen used Final Cut Pro to piece the various elements together. With a huge range of CGI and creature effects to deal with, the editing process on this movie was extremely complex. Final Cut Pro was used to create a lot of the background detail need to bring the green screen scenes to life.</p>

<p>4. 500 Days of Summer (2009)</p>
<p>This was a cute, quirky romantic comedy starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Alan Edward Bell in DVCPro HD format on Final Cut Pro. Because the storyline of the movie unfolds in a non-linear timeline, the workflow feature of Final Cut Pro made it easier to manage the sequencing of the different scenes. There were also 250 invisible effects which were created using Final Cut Pro’s editing features.</p>

<p>5. X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)</p>
<p>Continuing the X-Men franchise, this installment traces Wolverine’s childhood and the relationship with his brother. It didn’t really appeal to X-Men fans or movie critics.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Nicolas De Toth and Megan Gill. There were a number of continuity glitches identified during the production of this movie but De Toth and Gill used Final Pro Cut to keep a consistent flow to the narrative. What is interesting about the editing on this movie is that all the cutting of the scenes required was done on Final Cut Pro 5, taking advantage of the software’s HD abilities and also the multi-clip features.</p>

<p>6. Burn After Reading (2008)</p>
<p>A black comedy from the talented brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, they wrote, produced, edited, and directed the movie.</p>
<p>The Coen brothers used Final Cut Pro on this movie because it was simple and easy to use - they were blocking together the rough cuts as the scenes were being shot, and Final Cut Pro gave them the flexibility that they needed to edit quickly. On this movie most of the action was shot using Sony cameras but there were several scenes on which a RED camera was added when an additional camera was needed. Even though there is a significantly different workflow between the two types of camera, the RED material was able to be integrated smoothly with the Sony footage.</p>

                ></p>
<p>7. No Country for Old Men (2007)</p>
<p>A neo-Western thriller from Coen brothers. They directed, wrote, and edited this production.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing for editor Roderick Jaynes (a pseudonym for Joel and Ethan Coen).</p>
<p>Directing and editing a movie brings the two processes a lot closer together for the Coen brothers. An easy to use product such as Final Cut Pro ensures that they can construct the movie’s narrative using the timeline features of the product. This movie marked a chance in approach for the Coen brothers, who took advantage of the better resolution DVCPRO HD for their cutting process compared to earlier films that were cut at DV resolution.</p>

<p>8. 300 (2007)</p>
<p>Based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller, this is the fictionalized retelling of the Battle Termopylae - part of the Persian Wars. Directed by Zack Snyder, the movie was filmed with a super-imposition chroma key technique to help replicate the imagery of the original comic book. Editing on the movie was by William Hoy.</p>
<p>To capture the graphic novel look and feel of the film’s images, editor Hoy used a number of the key Final Cut Pro features such as the adjustment layer and blending modes to create depth and mood. With the look and feel of this movie so dependent on the effects created, editor Hoy spent a lot of time debating what was being added visually to each shot and how this would impact the length and continuity of each scene.</p>

<p>9. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004)</p>
<p>With big name stars (Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law), this was an unusual film that used digital artists to build multi-layered 2D and 3D backgrounds for live action footage, with hand-drawn storyboards recreated as computer-generated 3D animatics. Critically it was well received but didn’t set the box office alight.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Sabrina Plisco.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro was particularly critical to create a scene between two characters that was shot in a physical set (unlike the digital soundstage that was used for the rest of the movie). Final Cut Pro allowed the filmmakers to line up the animatics with the live onstage footage. One of the challenges with this movie is that the editors had to manually assign time-codes to each take - the clips were then rendered out and sorted so that they could be used on a Final Cut Pro SD workstation. This approach was also used to create the master off-line cut. Batch lists of the cuts were then imported into Final Cut Pro.</p>

                ></p>
<p>10. Cold Mountain (2003)</p>
<p>This is an epic Civil War drama based on the novel by Charles Frazier. Starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renee Zellweger this was critically acclaimed and performed reasonably well at the box office.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing let by editor Walter Murch.</p>
<p>This was really seen as the breakthrough movie for the use of Final Cut Pro in Hollywood Movies. An entire book has been produced analysing how editor Murch used Final Cut Pro to edit the movie and analysis its impact on future cinema productions. Editor Murch believes that the use of Final Cut Pro on this movie indirected affected the ultimate creative outcome. In particular, the use of the DVD authoring capabilities on Final Cut Pro meant that the editing team was able to look at the material more often, sharing it with more people, and changing the way that they looked at certain scenes.</p>
<hr>
<p>While Hollywood movies require editing tools of the highest order, the range of effects that you can achieve using Final Cut Pro is impressive - as well as the standard ripple, roll, slip, slide, scrub, razor blade and time remapping edit functions, Final Cut Pro also comes with a range of video transitions and a range of video and audio filters that will take your film project to the next level.</p>
<p>It is clear that Final Cut Pro is definitely now a star in the editing of Hollywood movies, it is time to make it a star in editing your movies as well.</p>

<p>2. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)</p>
<p>This was the US adaptation of the earlier Swedish film of the same name - based on the novel by Stieg Larsson. Starring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, the story is a crime thriller trying to uncover the secrets surrounding the disappearance of a young girl from a wealthy family.</p>
<p>One of the challenges with this movie was that there were a lot of invisible effects throughout the film. Final Cut Pro was used to achieve the shot stabilization and the visual enhancements - everything from matte painting to creating seasonal elements such as snow.</p>

<p>3. John Carter (2011)</p>
<p>A science fiction adventure, this film performed so badly at the box office that it caused major financial problems for its studio Disney.</p>
<p>The editing of the John Carter movie was a particular challenge as a lot of the action was shot twice during the troubled production. The editor Eric Zumbrunnen used Final Cut Pro to piece the various elements together. With a huge range of CGI and creature effects to deal with, the editing process on this movie was extremely complex. Final Cut Pro was used to create a lot of the background detail need to bring the green screen scenes to life.</p>

<p>4. 500 Days of Summer (2009)</p>
<p>This was a cute, quirky romantic comedy starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Alan Edward Bell in DVCPro HD format on Final Cut Pro. Because the storyline of the movie unfolds in a non-linear timeline, the workflow feature of Final Cut Pro made it easier to manage the sequencing of the different scenes. There were also 250 invisible effects which were created using Final Cut Pro’s editing features.</p>

<p>5. X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)</p>
<p>Continuing the X-Men franchise, this installment traces Wolverine’s childhood and the relationship with his brother. It didn’t really appeal to X-Men fans or movie critics.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Nicolas De Toth and Megan Gill. There were a number of continuity glitches identified during the production of this movie but De Toth and Gill used Final Pro Cut to keep a consistent flow to the narrative. What is interesting about the editing on this movie is that all the cutting of the scenes required was done on Final Cut Pro 5, taking advantage of the software’s HD abilities and also the multi-clip features.</p>

<p>6. Burn After Reading (2008)</p>
<p>A black comedy from the talented brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, they wrote, produced, edited, and directed the movie.</p>
<p>The Coen brothers used Final Cut Pro on this movie because it was simple and easy to use - they were blocking together the rough cuts as the scenes were being shot, and Final Cut Pro gave them the flexibility that they needed to edit quickly. On this movie most of the action was shot using Sony cameras but there were several scenes on which a RED camera was added when an additional camera was needed. Even though there is a significantly different workflow between the two types of camera, the RED material was able to be integrated smoothly with the Sony footage.</p>

<p>A neo-Western thriller from Coen brothers. They directed, wrote, and edited this production.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing for editor Roderick Jaynes (a pseudonym for Joel and Ethan Coen).</p>
<p>Directing and editing a movie brings the two processes a lot closer together for the Coen brothers. An easy to use product such as Final Cut Pro ensures that they can construct the movie’s narrative using the timeline features of the product. This movie marked a chance in approach for the Coen brothers, who took advantage of the better resolution DVCPRO HD for their cutting process compared to earlier films that were cut at DV resolution.</p>

<p>9. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004)</p>
<p>With big name stars (Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law), this was an unusual film that used digital artists to build multi-layered 2D and 3D backgrounds for live action footage, with hand-drawn storyboards recreated as computer-generated 3D animatics. Critically it was well received but didn’t set the box office alight.</p>

<p>While Hollywood movies require editing tools of the highest order, the range of effects that you can achieve using Final Cut Pro is impressive - as well as the standard ripple, roll, slip, slide, scrub, razor blade and time remapping edit functions, Final Cut Pro also comes with a range of video transitions and a range of video and audio filters that will take your film project to the next level.</p>
<p>It is clear that Final Cut Pro is definitely now a star in the editing of Hollywood movies, it is time to make it a star in editing your movies as well.</p>

<p>1. The Social Network (2010)</p>
<p>Based on the rise of the phenomenon that we now know as Facebook, The Social Network starred Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake. The movie performed well at the box office and was also positively received by movie critics.</p>
<p>The film won an Academy Award for Best Editing, collected by Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall. They used Final Cut Pro to edit the film, and one of the things they really like about the software is the ability to do multiple timelines. Final Cut Pro was also used in this movie to enable face replacement in a number of scenes. Two of the key characters in the movie are twins, and so the scenes were filmed with actors (who weren’t twins) and then the editing software was used to create the illusion that they were twins. Digital matte paintings was another feature of this movie that relied on the functionality of Final Cut Pro.</p>

<p>One of the challenges with this movie was that there were a lot of invisible effects throughout the film. Final Cut Pro was used to achieve the shot stabilization and the visual enhancements - everything from matte painting to creating seasonal elements such as snow.</p>

                ></p>
<p>1. The Social Network (2010)</p>
<p>Based on the rise of the phenomenon that we now know as Facebook, The Social Network starred Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake. The movie performed well at the box office and was also positively received by movie critics.</p>
<p>The film won an Academy Award for Best Editing, collected by Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall. They used Final Cut Pro to edit the film, and one of the things they really like about the software is the ability to do multiple timelines. Final Cut Pro was also used in this movie to enable face replacement in a number of scenes. Two of the key characters in the movie are twins, and so the scenes were filmed with actors (who weren’t twins) and then the editing software was used to create the illusion that they were twins. Digital matte paintings was another feature of this movie that relied on the functionality of Final Cut Pro.</p>

                ></p>
<p>2. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)</p>
<p>This was the US adaptation of the earlier Swedish film of the same name - based on the novel by Stieg Larsson. Starring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, the story is a crime thriller trying to uncover the secrets surrounding the disappearance of a young girl from a wealthy family.</p>
<p>One of the challenges with this movie was that there were a lot of invisible effects throughout the film. Final Cut Pro was used to achieve the shot stabilization and the visual enhancements - everything from matte painting to creating seasonal elements such as snow.</p>

                ></p>
<p>3. John Carter (2011)</p>
<p>A science fiction adventure, this film performed so badly at the box office that it caused major financial problems for its studio Disney.</p>
<p>The editing of the John Carter movie was a particular challenge as a lot of the action was shot twice during the troubled production. The editor Eric Zumbrunnen used Final Cut Pro to piece the various elements together. With a huge range of CGI and creature effects to deal with, the editing process on this movie was extremely complex. Final Cut Pro was used to create a lot of the background detail need to bring the green screen scenes to life.</p>

<p>4. 500 Days of Summer (2009)</p>
<p>This was a cute, quirky romantic comedy starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Alan Edward Bell in DVCPro HD format on Final Cut Pro. Because the storyline of the movie unfolds in a non-linear timeline, the workflow feature of Final Cut Pro made it easier to manage the sequencing of the different scenes. There were also 250 invisible effects which were created using Final Cut Pro’s editing features.</p>

                ></p>
<p>5. X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)</p>
<p>Continuing the X-Men franchise, this installment traces Wolverine’s childhood and the relationship with his brother. It didn’t really appeal to X-Men fans or movie critics.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Nicolas De Toth and Megan Gill. There were a number of continuity glitches identified during the production of this movie but De Toth and Gill used Final Pro Cut to keep a consistent flow to the narrative. What is interesting about the editing on this movie is that all the cutting of the scenes required was done on Final Cut Pro 5, taking advantage of the software’s HD abilities and also the multi-clip features.</p>

<p>6. Burn After Reading (2008)</p>
<p>A black comedy from the talented brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, they wrote, produced, edited, and directed the movie.</p>
<p>The Coen brothers used Final Cut Pro on this movie because it was simple and easy to use - they were blocking together the rough cuts as the scenes were being shot, and Final Cut Pro gave them the flexibility that they needed to edit quickly. On this movie most of the action was shot using Sony cameras but there were several scenes on which a RED camera was added when an additional camera was needed. Even though there is a significantly different workflow between the two types of camera, the RED material was able to be integrated smoothly with the Sony footage.</p>

                ></p>
<p>7. No Country for Old Men (2007)</p>
<p>A neo-Western thriller from Coen brothers. They directed, wrote, and edited this production.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing for editor Roderick Jaynes (a pseudonym for Joel and Ethan Coen).</p>
<p>Directing and editing a movie brings the two processes a lot closer together for the Coen brothers. An easy to use product such as Final Cut Pro ensures that they can construct the movie’s narrative using the timeline features of the product. This movie marked a chance in approach for the Coen brothers, who took advantage of the better resolution DVCPRO HD for their cutting process compared to earlier films that were cut at DV resolution.</p>

<p>8. 300 (2007)</p>
<p>Based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller, this is the fictionalized retelling of the Battle Termopylae - part of the Persian Wars. Directed by Zack Snyder, the movie was filmed with a super-imposition chroma key technique to help replicate the imagery of the original comic book. Editing on the movie was by William Hoy.</p>
<p>To capture the graphic novel look and feel of the film’s images, editor Hoy used a number of the key Final Cut Pro features such as the adjustment layer and blending modes to create depth and mood. With the look and feel of this movie so dependent on the effects created, editor Hoy spent a lot of time debating what was being added visually to each shot and how this would impact the length and continuity of each scene.</p>

<p>9. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004)</p>
<p>With big name stars (Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law), this was an unusual film that used digital artists to build multi-layered 2D and 3D backgrounds for live action footage, with hand-drawn storyboards recreated as computer-generated 3D animatics. Critically it was well received but didn’t set the box office alight.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Sabrina Plisco.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro was particularly critical to create a scene between two characters that was shot in a physical set (unlike the digital soundstage that was used for the rest of the movie). Final Cut Pro allowed the filmmakers to line up the animatics with the live onstage footage. One of the challenges with this movie is that the editors had to manually assign time-codes to each take - the clips were then rendered out and sorted so that they could be used on a Final Cut Pro SD workstation. This approach was also used to create the master off-line cut. Batch lists of the cuts were then imported into Final Cut Pro.</p>

                ></p>
<p>10. Cold Mountain (2003)</p>
<p>This is an epic Civil War drama based on the novel by Charles Frazier. Starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renee Zellweger this was critically acclaimed and performed reasonably well at the box office.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing let by editor Walter Murch.</p>
<p>This was really seen as the breakthrough movie for the use of Final Cut Pro in Hollywood Movies. An entire book has been produced analysing how editor Murch used Final Cut Pro to edit the movie and analysis its impact on future cinema productions. Editor Murch believes that the use of Final Cut Pro on this movie indirected affected the ultimate creative outcome. In particular, the use of the DVD authoring capabilities on Final Cut Pro meant that the editing team was able to look at the material more often, sharing it with more people, and changing the way that they looked at certain scenes.</p>
<hr>
<p>While Hollywood movies require editing tools of the highest order, the range of effects that you can achieve using Final Cut Pro is impressive - as well as the standard ripple, roll, slip, slide, scrub, razor blade and time remapping edit functions, Final Cut Pro also comes with a range of video transitions and a range of video and audio filters that will take your film project to the next level.</p>
<p>It is clear that Final Cut Pro is definitely now a star in the editing of Hollywood movies, it is time to make it a star in editing your movies as well.</p>

<p>As it is now the second decade of the 21st century, data carriers like DVDs are slowly becoming obsolete. A growing number of laptop and desktop PCs no longer feature optical disc drives, while the discontinuation of the Windows Media Center marked the end of an era in which Windows OS offered a built-in DVD player.</p>
<p>The Windows 10 doesn’t have a native app that enables you to play movies or music from DVD and Blu-ray discs, and you must install a third-party DVD<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to view content from these sources. Luckily there is no shortage of media players that are compatible with Windows 10, so in this article, we are going to take you through some of the <strong>best free DVD players</strong> on the market and help you choose the one that meets all your needs.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Free-DVD-Players-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Best-Free-DVD-Players-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Best Free DVD Players for Windows 10"></a>Best Free DVD Players for Windows 10</h2><p>Before you opt for one DVD player or the other you must first check which audio and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video file formats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> they support or find out if you can use them to play Blu-ray discs. You should also check a player’s compatibility with the operating system you have installed on your computer and that you have all the codecs necessary to play ISO and other image, audio and video file format. So let’s take a look at ten best free DVD players for Windows 10.</p>
<h3 id="1-VLC-Media-Player-by-VideoLan"><a href="#1-VLC-Media-Player-by-VideoLan" class="headerlink" title="1.

This cross-platform app can be used on Macs, PCs, Linux computers and Smartphones to play different types of audio, image and video files.

<p>The codecs you will have to install on your PC depends on the type of content you would like to watch. MPC-HC provides support for  or  codecs, but it is better to install a full codec pack and ensure that you have all the codecs you need to play audio and video files.
