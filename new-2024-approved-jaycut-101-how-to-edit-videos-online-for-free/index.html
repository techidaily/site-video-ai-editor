<p>JayCut is a flash-based free online video editor, similar to Yahoo!’s Jumpcut (closed now). It enables people to upload video, audio and more in order to create “mixes” or movies. The most impressive feature is that you can export videos to mobile devices, PC and YouTube. Until now, it’s considered as the best online video editor and is getting better and better since released in 2007.</p>
<p>JayCut has everything you need to have a free video editing trial, including default videos, images and audio. You even don’t need to register to use all the functions. However, once registered, you get free and easier to share movies with family and friends.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>: JayCut does all you could imagine in a single web page. Actually, it amazes me and my friends. I like everything about this website. It is very user friendly and allows you to upload different types of media very quickly, and then mix them together. The mixing becomes more of a work of art and one feels a sense of ownership when then have added titles, transitions and music to their pictures or video. Lastly I really like the fact that each person creates his or her own profile page. The profile makes it a fun way of learning about other people and it can be fun because it is similar to Facebook or Myspace.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> If people would expect more, maybe the develop team could add more transitions and text effects, and suit the needs to export to facebook and a choice to select DVD service.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Jaycut is a quick and easy-to-use website video editor. It’s fun and interactive. The design is so intuitive that people could easily understand how to use everything the website offers.</p>

<p>JayCut is a flash-based free online video editor, similar to Yahoo!’s Jumpcut (closed now). It enables people to upload video, audio and more in order to create “mixes” or movies. The most impressive feature is that you can export videos to mobile devices, PC and YouTube. Until now, it’s considered as the best online video editor and is getting better and better since released in 2007.</p>
<p>JayCut has everything you need to have a free video editing trial, including default videos, images and audio. You even don’t need to register to use all the functions. However, once registered, you get free and easier to share movies with family and friends.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>: JayCut does all you could imagine in a single web page. Actually, it amazes me and my friends. I like everything about this website. It is very user friendly and allows you to upload different types of media very quickly, and then mix them together. The mixing becomes more of a work of art and one feels a sense of ownership when then have added titles, transitions and music to their pictures or video. Lastly I really like the fact that each person creates his or her own profile page. The profile makes it a fun way of learning about other people and it can be fun because it is similar to Facebook or Myspace.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> If people would expect more, maybe the develop team could add more transitions and text effects, and suit the needs to export to facebook and a choice to select DVD service.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Jaycut is a quick and easy-to-use website video editor. It’s fun and interactive. The design is so intuitive that people could easily understand how to use everything the website offers.</p>

<p> Cable, satellite, over the air broadcast, streaming internet video – never before have we had so many choices of how to receive television programming. DVR, PVR, computer hard drive, external storage device; now we have choices in how to store programs for viewing later to consider as well. So what is true and what is hype when it comes to what’s the best device? Let’s peel back the layers and look at the information.</p>
<p> First, what is a DVR? A DVR, or digital video recorder, is a device that records video from a source for playback at another time. It often comes with a television programming guide included so you can easily locate shows you want to record. Most DVRs come with large capacity hard drives, though some have flash memory cards as their storage medium. There are a variety of types that range from small storage capacity and two tuners, up through several tuners and massive hard drive storage ability. You also can pause and rewind live TV, which is great when you want to create your own sports instant replays. Most DVRs also allow you to watch one program that was previously recorded while two others are recording, though some have greater capacity.</p>
<p> A TiVo is a particular kind of DVR that was first introduced in 1999. It requires a subscription to its own programming guide that can be purchased month to month, or as a “lifetime” subscription (that means the life of the TiVo, not your life, by the way). TiVos, like cable company DVRs, can record just one show or an entire season. TiVos have a smart feature which notices which shows you are watching and recommends similar ones to you based on how you rate current programs. It also uses these ratings to suggest shows to other viewers.</p>
<p> Let’s look at a few of the main features of both so you can do a comparison. We’ll look at five factors.</p>
<h2 id="1-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Cost-and-rent-versus-own"><a href="#1-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Cost-and-rent-versus-own" class="headerlink" title="1. TiVo vs Comcast: Cost and rent versus own"></a>1. TiVo vs Comcast: Cost and rent versus own</h2><p> With a Comcast DVR, you are renting it from the cable company at a cost of $10 to $16 a month, depending on your market. There are no upfront costs, and should the device fail, you can swap it at no cost at your local Comcast service center. Some folks have found that the new X1 boxes are prone to crashes, so that free swap is handy.</p>
<p> A TiVo is yours to keep as long as it lasts or as long as you want it, whichever comes first. It has an initial cost of between $200 and $600, depending on the model. Plus, you have the subscription cost on top of the unit price, which is $15 a month or $500 for a “lifetime” subscription, which TiVo may or may not give you partial credit for should your device fail and you need a new one. Like the Comcast DVRs, some TiVo boxes are less than stable. It’s the nature of electronics. TiVos also have advertising on them, which some Comcast channels do also, like MusicChoice, but not on all of them.</p>
<h2 id="2-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Services-available"><a href="#2-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Services-available" class="headerlink" title="2. TiVo vs Comcast: Services available"></a>2. TiVo vs Comcast: Services available</h2><p> With a DVR from Comcast, you can only record shows that are broadcast on one of Comcast’s channels or play shows that are loaded into its On Demand section. A TiVo can be connected to a number of sources, including cable via a cable card, and allow you to combine all of your viewing sources into the one box. It even connects to a high definition antenna.</p>
<p> The TiVo with cable card has access to all of the cable On Demand services, so in that sense it can replace all of the Comcast DVRs. However, the cable card is not free. It typically runs $1.50 per card per month, up to $2.50 per card on the Frontier system.</p>
<p> The menus are slightly different, as you can see below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/tivo-comcast-interface.jpg"
                      alt="tivo comcast interface"
                ></p>
<p> Comcast interface</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/comcast-menu.jpg"
                      alt="comcast-menu"
                ></p>
<p> TiVo interface</p>
<p> TiVos also recognize SD and HD as just different versions of the same show, instead of different channels like Comcast does, so you can set your DVR to just record HD. This makes it somewhat harder to just record HD on a TiVo.</p>
<p> Down the road, Comcast is planning the X2 system which would have cloud recording capacity, thus ending the need for a box in your house at all. TiVo has not yet announced such a plan.</p>
<h2 id="3-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Connection-to-a-network"><a href="#3-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Connection-to-a-network" class="headerlink" title="3. TiVo vs Comcast: Connection to a network"></a>3. TiVo vs Comcast: Connection to a network</h2><p> TiVos can be connected to your home computer network, and the newest one, the Roamio, comes with built-in wifi, for total freedom of use. Because it’s on the network, you can stream shows from your computer through the TiVo box for later playback. It supports channels like Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Amazon Instant. You can also stream shows to your Apple portable devices and then take the shows with you on the plane or to the gym, or use the device as a remote control. (Android devices will have the same capacity soon.) The network capacity also means you can use your computer to control the TiVo box and view content wherever you are.</p>
<p> Some reviewers have also noted that the network set up is not as simple as it might be, and it requires some computer knowledge and ability. Unless you have a tech person nearby, novice computer users may not wish to set up the network.</p>
<p> The iPhone app remote screen looks like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/iphone-app.jpg"
                      alt="iphone app"
                ></p>
<p> A TiVo does have limitations of who can access which channels. For instance, it does not stream HBOGo, nor does it interface with Apple’s TV programming. For that you still need an AppleTV device.</p>
<p> Comcast boxes simply do not network well. They are designed to broadcast the cable signals through your TV, but not on a home network. They are often easier to connect, however, just requiring a cable from the box to be plugged into the TV.</p>
<h2 id="4-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Recording-capacity"><a href="#4-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Recording-capacity" class="headerlink" title="4. TiVo vs Comcast: Recording capacity"></a>4. TiVo vs Comcast: Recording capacity</h2><p> The new TiVo, the Roamio, has as many as six tuners that can record at the same time with up to 150 hours of high definition programming.

<p> TiVos have recording capacities that range from 75 to 450 hours, depending on whether it is standard definition or high definition, and which device you are using. You can choose from three models of the Roamio. The base model costs $200 and has 75 hours of capacity. The menu and features are more limited on this one than on the others. There is a middle model priced at $400 that has the same six tuners as the high-end one but can only hold 150 hours of recordings. Then the top tier model costs $600 and has 450 hours of recording capacity, all of it in high definition.</p>
<p> The Comcast X1 DVR has four tuners and it can record them simultaneously. You can watch a prerecorded program while it’s recording, too. It can hold 120 hours of HD or 600 hours of SD programming.</p>

<p> Cable, satellite, over the air broadcast, streaming internet video – never before have we had so many choices of how to receive television programming. DVR, PVR, computer hard drive, external storage device; now we have choices in how to store programs for viewing later to consider as well. So what is true and what is hype when it comes to what’s the best device? Let’s peel back the layers and look at the information.</p>
<p> First, what is a DVR? A DVR, or digital video recorder, is a device that records video from a source for playback at another time. It often comes with a television programming guide included so you can easily locate shows you want to record. Most DVRs come with large capacity hard drives, though some have flash memory cards as their storage medium. There are a variety of types that range from small storage capacity and two tuners, up through several tuners and massive hard drive storage ability. You also can pause and rewind live TV, which is great when you want to create your own sports instant replays. Most DVRs also allow you to watch one program that was previously recorded while two others are recording, though some have greater capacity.</p>
<p> A TiVo is a particular kind of DVR that was first introduced in 1999. It requires a subscription to its own programming guide that can be purchased month to month, or as a “lifetime” subscription (that means the life of the TiVo, not your life, by the way). TiVos, like cable company DVRs, can record just one show or an entire season. TiVos have a smart feature which notices which shows you are watching and recommends similar ones to you based on how you rate current programs. It also uses these ratings to suggest shows to other viewers.</p>
<p> Let’s look at a few of the main features of both so you can do a comparison. We’ll look at five factors.</p>
<h2 id="1-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Cost-and-rent-versus-own-1"><a href="#1-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Cost-and-rent-versus-own-1" class="headerlink" title="1. TiVo vs Comcast: Cost and rent versus own"></a>1. TiVo vs Comcast: Cost and rent versus own</h2><p> With a Comcast DVR, you are renting it from the cable company at a cost of $10 to $16 a month, depending on your market. There are no upfront costs, and should the device fail, you can swap it at no cost at your local Comcast service center. Some folks have found that the new X1 boxes are prone to crashes, so that free swap is handy.</p>
<p> A TiVo is yours to keep as long as it lasts or as long as you want it, whichever comes first. It has an initial cost of between $200 and $600, depending on the model. Plus, you have the subscription cost on top of the unit price, which is $15 a month or $500 for a “lifetime” subscription, which TiVo may or may not give you partial credit for should your device fail and you need a new one. Like the Comcast DVRs, some TiVo boxes are less than stable. It’s the nature of electronics. TiVos also have advertising on them, which some Comcast channels do also, like MusicChoice, but not on all of them.</p>
<h2 id="2-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Services-available-1"><a href="#2-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Services-available-1" class="headerlink" title="2. TiVo vs Comcast: Services available"></a>2. TiVo vs Comcast: Services available</h2><p> With a DVR from Comcast, you can only record shows that are broadcast on one of Comcast’s channels or play shows that are loaded into its On Demand section. A TiVo can be connected to a number of sources, including cable via a cable card, and allow you to combine all of your viewing sources into the one box. It even connects to a high definition antenna.</p>
<p> The TiVo with cable card has access to all of the cable On Demand services, so in that sense it can replace all of the Comcast DVRs. However, the cable card is not free. It typically runs $1.50 per card per month, up to $2.50 per card on the Frontier system.</p>
<p> The menus are slightly different, as you can see below.</p>

                ></p>
<p> TiVo interface</p>
<p> TiVos also recognize SD and HD as just different versions of the same show, instead of different channels like Comcast does, so you can set your DVR to just record HD. This makes it somewhat harder to just record HD on a TiVo.</p>
<p> Down the road, Comcast is planning the X2 system which would have cloud recording capacity, thus ending the need for a box in your house at all. TiVo has not yet announced such a plan.</p>
<h2 id="3-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Connection-to-a-network-1"><a href="#3-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Connection-to-a-network-1" class="headerlink" title="3. TiVo vs Comcast: Connection to a network"></a>3. TiVo vs Comcast: Connection to a network</h2><p> TiVos can be connected to your home computer network, and the newest one, the Roamio, comes with built-in wifi, for total freedom of use. Because it’s on the network, you can stream shows from your computer through the TiVo box for later playback. It supports channels like Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Amazon Instant. You can also stream shows to your Apple portable devices and then take the shows with you on the plane or to the gym, or use the device as a remote control. (Android devices will have the same capacity soon.) The network capacity also means you can use your computer to control the TiVo box and view content wherever you are.</p>
<p> Some reviewers have also noted that the network set up is not as simple as it might be, and it requires some computer knowledge and ability. Unless you have a tech person nearby, novice computer users may not wish to set up the network.</p>
<p> The iPhone app remote screen looks like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="iphone app"
                ></p>
<p> A TiVo does have limitations of who can access which channels. For instance, it does not stream HBOGo, nor does it interface with Apple’s TV programming. For that you still need an AppleTV device.</p>
<p> Comcast boxes simply do not network well. They are designed to broadcast the cable signals through your TV, but not on a home network. They are often easier to connect, however, just requiring a cable from the box to be plugged into the TV.</p>
<h2 id="4-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Recording-capacity-1"><a href="#4-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Recording-capacity-1" class="headerlink" title="4. TiVo vs Comcast: Recording capacity"></a>4.

<p> A TiVo does have limitations of who can access which channels. For instance, it does not stream HBOGo, nor does it interface with Apple’s TV programming. For that you still need an AppleTV device.</p>
<p> Comcast boxes simply do not network well. They are designed to broadcast the cable signals through your TV, but not on a home network. They are often easier to connect, however, just requiring a cable from the box to be plugged into the TV.</p>

<p> TiVos have recording capacities that range from 75 to 450 hours, depending on whether it is standard definition or high definition, and which device you are using. You can choose from three models of the Roamio. The base model costs $200 and has 75 hours of capacity. The menu and features are more limited on this one than on the others. There is a middle model priced at $400 that has the same six tuners as the high-end one but can only hold 150 hours of recordings. Then the top tier model costs $600 and has 450 hours of recording capacity, all of it in high definition.</p>
<p> The Comcast X1 DVR has four tuners and it can record them simultaneously. You can watch a prerecorded program while it’s recording, too. It can hold 120 hours of HD or 600 hours of SD programming.</p>

<h5 id="Ollie-Mattison-7"><a href="#Ollie-Mattison-7" class="headerlink" title="Ollie Mattison"></a>Ollie Mattison</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p>
<p> Cable, satellite, over the air broadcast, streaming internet video – never before have we had so many choices of how to receive television programming. DVR, PVR, computer hard drive, external storage device; now we have choices in how to store programs for viewing later to consider as well. So what is true and what is hype when it comes to what’s the best device? Let’s peel back the layers and look at the information.</p>
<p> First, what is a DVR? A DVR, or digital video recorder, is a device that records video from a source for playback at another time. It often comes with a television programming guide included so you can easily locate shows you want to record. Most DVRs come with large capacity hard drives, though some have flash memory cards as their storage medium. There are a variety of types that range from small storage capacity and two tuners, up through several tuners and massive hard drive storage ability. You also can pause and rewind live TV, which is great when you want to create your own sports instant replays. Most DVRs also allow you to watch one program that was previously recorded while two others are recording, though some have greater capacity.</p>
<p> A TiVo is a particular kind of DVR that was first introduced in 1999. It requires a subscription to its own programming guide that can be purchased month to month, or as a “lifetime” subscription (that means the life of the TiVo, not your life, by the way). TiVos, like cable company DVRs, can record just one show or an entire season. TiVos have a smart feature which notices which shows you are watching and recommends similar ones to you based on how you rate current programs. It also uses these ratings to suggest shows to other viewers.</p>
<p> Let’s look at a few of the main features of both so you can do a comparison. We’ll look at five factors.</p>
<h2 id="1-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Cost-and-rent-versus-own-3"><a href="#1-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Cost-and-rent-versus-own-3" class="headerlink" title="1. TiVo vs Comcast: Cost and rent versus own"></a>1. TiVo vs Comcast: Cost and rent versus own</h2><p> With a Comcast DVR, you are renting it from the cable company at a cost of $10 to $16 a month, depending on your market. There are no upfront costs, and should the device fail, you can swap it at no cost at your local Comcast service center. Some folks have found that the new X1 boxes are prone to crashes, so that free swap is handy.</p>
<p> A TiVo is yours to keep as long as it lasts or as long as you want it, whichever comes first. It has an initial cost of between $200 and $600, depending on the model. Plus, you have the subscription cost on top of the unit price, which is $15 a month or $500 for a “lifetime” subscription, which TiVo may or may not give you partial credit for should your device fail and you need a new one. Like the Comcast DVRs, some TiVo boxes are less than stable. It’s the nature of electronics. TiVos also have advertising on them, which some Comcast channels do also, like MusicChoice, but not on all of them.</p>
<h2 id="2-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Services-available-3"><a href="#2-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Services-available-3" class="headerlink" title="2. TiVo vs Comcast: Services available"></a>2. TiVo vs Comcast: Services available</h2><p> With a DVR from Comcast, you can only record shows that are broadcast on one of Comcast’s channels or play shows that are loaded into its On Demand section. A TiVo can be connected to a number of sources, including cable via a cable card, and allow you to combine all of your viewing sources into the one box. It even connects to a high definition antenna.</p>
<p> The TiVo with cable card has access to all of the cable On Demand services, so in that sense it can replace all of the Comcast DVRs. However, the cable card is not free. It typically runs $1.50 per card per month, up to $2.50 per card on the Frontier system.</p>
<p> The menus are slightly different, as you can see below.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="comcast-menu"
                ></p>
<p> TiVo interface</p>
<p> TiVos also recognize SD and HD as just different versions of the same show, instead of different channels like Comcast does, so you can set your DVR to just record HD. This makes it somewhat harder to just record HD on a TiVo.</p>
<p> Down the road, Comcast is planning the X2 system which would have cloud recording capacity, thus ending the need for a box in your house at all. TiVo has not yet announced such a plan.</p>
<h2 id="3-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Connection-to-a-network-3"><a href="#3-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Connection-to-a-network-3" class="headerlink" title="3. TiVo vs Comcast: Connection to a network"></a>3. TiVo vs Comcast: Connection to a network</h2><p> TiVos can be connected to your home computer network, and the newest one, the Roamio, comes with built-in wifi, for total freedom of use. Because it’s on the network, you can stream shows from your computer through the TiVo box for later playback. It supports channels like Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Amazon Instant. You can also stream shows to your Apple portable devices and then take the shows with you on the plane or to the gym, or use the device as a remote control. (Android devices will have the same capacity soon.) The network capacity also means you can use your computer to control the TiVo box and view content wherever you are.</p>
<p> Some reviewers have also noted that the network set up is not as simple as it might be, and it requires some computer knowledge and ability. Unless you have a tech person nearby, novice computer users may not wish to set up the network.</p>
<p> The iPhone app remote screen looks like this:</p>

<h3 id="1-iMovie-3"><a href="#1-iMovie-3" class="headerlink" title="1. iMovie"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imovie/id377298193" >iMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p>All iPhones and iPads offer a free way to edit all videos you record with them. All you need to do is make sure that iMovie is installed on your iPhone or iPad and you can start editing the footage you recorded. In addition, you can also import videos recorded with different types of cameras into iMovie, as long as they are saved in the file format that is compatible with this app.</p>
<p>iMovie offers a variety of predesigned trailer themes, so you just have to pick the one you like the most and then choose the footage you want to include in your trailer. Keep in mind that you cannot add music to any of the trailer themes, but you can export the trailer you created and create the soundtrack from iMovie’s Video mode. What’s more, you can also use this app to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >add transitions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, visual effects or <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >titles <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to the trailers you create with iMovie.</p>

<p>You don’t have to be a seasoned filmmaker to create professionally looking trailers with Intro.Maker + 3D Movie Trailer. The app lets you choose from hundreds of HD templates that can be customized quickly to meet the demands of your project. Moreover, you can create your own templates and use them on all future projects. Videos that are saved on the device’s camera roll can be easily imported into the app, which means that you can start making a new trailer just moments after recording the footage.</p>
<p>The trailers you create with the free version of Intro.Maker + 3D Movie Trailer are going to be watermarked and you must make an in-app purchase in order to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >remove the watermark <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

<p>Making a trailer or an intro for the videos you share online shouldn’t take too much of your time. This iPhone app offers an easy solution to all vloggers and video content creators who want to create trailers for their film projects from their phones. There are more than a thousand customizable templates to choose from, as well as over 700 motion stickers. In addition, the app doesn’t limit the number of titles you can add to a single project, and it lets you adjust the size, shadow and stroke values for each title you include in a video.</p>
<p>Even though the app doesn’t have a library of <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty-free songs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you can still use it to create soundtracks or even record voiceovers for your trailers. Moreover, the app’s file-sharing capabilities are underwhelming since you can only export videos to the camera roll. Purchasing the Intro Maker Premium or Premium Life Time subscription plans can be a good idea if you want to create new trailers and intros frequently.</p>
