<h5 id="Shanoon-Cox"><a href="#Shanoon-Cox" class="headerlink" title="Shanoon Cox"></a>Shanoon Cox</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p>
<p>It has been some time since Microsoft stopped all support for Windows 7, which left PC users without the<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >iMovie equivalent Windows Movie Maker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Moreover, Windows 10 doesn’t have a built-in app that is dedicated solely to video editing.</p>
<p>However, you shouldn’t panic if you are looking for <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editing software for Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> since there are plenty of free and affordable options to choose from. In fact, finding an app you can use to polish your videos on PC computers, shouldn’t be too difficult even if you have no previous video editing experience.</p>
<p>That is why in this article we are going to take you through some of the best iMovie replacements for Windows 10 you can use to create stunning videos that are going to attract the attention of your online audience.</p>
<h2 id="Top-5-iMovie-Replacements-for-Windows-10-Free-Paid"><a href="#Top-5-iMovie-Replacements-for-Windows-10-Free-Paid" class="headerlink" title="Top 5 iMovie Replacements for Windows 10 [Free &amp; Paid]"></a>Top 5 iMovie Replacements for Windows 10 [Free &amp; Paid]</h2><p>iMovie isn’t designed to perform demanding video editing tasks, which is the reason why we selected the video editing software products that are aimed at newcomers to the video editing world. So let’s take a look at some of the best video editing apps for Windows 10 you can use as a replacement for iMovie.</p>
<h3 id="1-Windows-10-Photos-App"><a href="#1-Windows-10-Photos-App" class="headerlink" title="1. Windows 10 Photos App"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-photos/9wzdncrfjbh4?activetab=pivot:overviewtab" >Windows 10 Photos App <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>The Photos app is the only built-in app on Windows 10 that offers video editing features. Even though the app is designed to help PC users view, organize and edit photos, you can still use it to perform basic video editing tasks.</p>
<p>You can either choose to start working on a new project from scratch or to create a video automatically. In case you decide to make a video automatically, you just have to select the footage, name your project and wait for the Photos App to generate a new video for you.</p>
<p>Opting to edit your footage manually will enable you to trim or split video clips, alter their playback speed and apply filters to the footage. Optionally, you can also add text layers to your videos, use motion effects to simulate camera movement, or use some available 3D filters. Exporting projects in resolutions higher than 1080p or uploading your videos directly to social media from the Photos app isn’t an option.</p>

You can export all your projects to your accounts on Vimeo or YouTube directly from Filmora, but you should keep in mind that all videos created with the free version of this video editor are going to be watermarked.</p>

Optionally, you can also add text layers to your videos, use motion effects to simulate camera movement, or use some available 3D filters.

<p>It has been some time since Microsoft stopped all support for Windows 7, which left PC users without the<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >iMovie equivalent Windows Movie Maker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Moreover, Windows 10 doesn’t have a built-in app that is dedicated solely to video editing.</p>
<p>However, you shouldn’t panic if you are looking for <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editing software for Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> since there are plenty of free and affordable options to choose from. In fact, finding an app you can use to polish your videos on PC computers, shouldn’t be too difficult even if you have no previous video editing experience.</p>
<p>That is why in this article we are going to take you through some of the best iMovie replacements for Windows 10 you can use to create stunning videos that are going to attract the attention of your online audience.</p>

So let’s take a look at some of the best video editing apps for Windows 10 you can use as a replacement for iMovie.</p>
<h3 id="1-Windows-10-Photos-App-3"><a href="#1-Windows-10-Photos-App-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

Even though the app is designed to help PC users view, organize and edit photos, you can still use it to perform basic video editing tasks.</p>
<p>You can either choose to start working on a new project from scratch or to create a video automatically. In case you decide to make a video automatically, you just have to select the footage, name your project and wait for the Photos App to generate a new video for you.</p>
<p>Opting to edit your footage manually will enable you to trim or split video clips, alter their playback speed and apply filters to the footage. Optionally, you can also add text layers to your videos, use motion effects to simulate camera movement, or use some available 3D filters. Exporting projects in resolutions higher than 1080p or uploading your videos directly to social media from the Photos app isn’t an option.</p>

<p>Wondershare’s video editor provides support for 4K videos, and it is compatible with almost all commonly used video file formats. Starting a new project or importing the footage into Filmora is a straightforward process that requires a minimum amount of effort. Creating the opening titles, enhancing the colors in video clips, applying filters and image overlays are just a few among the countless video editing options Filmora provides.</p>
<p>What’s more, the video editor is equipped with a music library that contains a selection of royalty-free songs, which enables you to create a soundtrack even if you don’t have the music you can use in your videos. You can export all your projects to your accounts on Vimeo or YouTube directly from Filmora, but you should keep in mind that all videos created with the free version of this video editor are going to be watermarked.</p>

So, in this article, we are going to introduce you to some of the best time-lapse apps for iPhone and Android devices in 2020.</p>

<p>Brightening an iPhone video can help you see the activity on-screen and make it more appealing if you share it on social media or post it to a website.</p>
<p>Because the iPhone’s built-in camera app does not enable you to brighten films after they have been recorded, you should always try to light a video before you begin recording.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Switch to video mode by opening the camera app and swiping left. Touch the screen to bring up a box with a sun-shaped symbol.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Move your fingers upward on the iPhone screen to brighten the scene when you begin filming. This may be done at any moment while the video is being recorded.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>There are a ton of <strong>Video Brightening Editor Apps</strong> that will make brightening the videos after filming quite easy for you. Long gone are the days when you had to re-film now and again until you would get that one final shot that has every color adjustment aspect fit to perfection. With the advent of amazing software such as those covered in this article, brightening a dark video has never been easier!</p>

<p>This video editing platform allows you to create a broad range of different types of videos, as it offers whiteboard animation, explainer video or movie trailer templates, among numerous others. Creating an account on MakeWebVideo is the mandatory step you need to take before you can start working on a new movie trailer. You just have to upload the footage, insert up to 21 lines of text, apply the visual effects to your footage, and MakeWebVideo will do the rest for you. All test versions of video trailers are free, but if you want to download them in full HD resolution you must pay a $29.00 one-time fee. In return, the platform will offer the hosting services for the video trailer you created as well as the media player viewers can use to watch the trailer.</p>

<p>The process of creating a video trailer with Renderforest can be completed in just three simple steps. You just have to select a template, insert title scenes, videos, photos or logo animations and then decide if you want to publish the trailer on social media or download it to your computer. Renderforest grants you access to huge libraries of stock footage that are perfectly adjusted to the genre of the video trailer you select, which means that you don’t even need your own footage to create a trailer with this platform. Furthermore, you can also choose if you want to use the platform’s music library or upload the audio file you intend to use as a soundtrack for the video trailer you are making. It is worth noting that the free version of Renderforest doesn’t allow users to create videos that are longer than three minutes.</p>

<p>LightMV is a video content creation platform that allows its users to turn their photos into videos. Simply choose a template from Social Media, Fashion, or Travel categories and upload the images to the template. The number of images you can include in a video trailer varies from template to template, although you can purchase lollies, the platform’s virtual money, that enables you to increase the number of images you can add to a template. Even though all templates have built-in soundtracks, you can add a new song from the platform’s music library or from your computer. LightMV can be used from a web browser, installed as software on a PC computer or downloaded as an app from Google Play or App Store.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>LightMV offers an easy way to turn photos into videos</li>
<li>All templates are easily customizable</li>
<li>Equipped with basic audio editing tools</li>
<li>Good social sharing options</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Downloading videos is only possible if you purchase lollies</li>
<li>No video editing tools</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>All film productions regardless of how big or small they are can benefit from online promotion. Each of the online video trailer makers we featured in this article is easy to use, and you don’t need a lot of video editing experience in order to customize a video trailer template.</p>
