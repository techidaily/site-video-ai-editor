<h3 id="1-Window-Media-Player"><a href="#1-Window-Media-Player" class="headerlink" title="1. Window Media Player"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-windows-media-player-81718e0d-cfce-25b1-aee3-94596b658287" >Window Media Player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Windows Media Player offers a clean and intuitive interface, outstanding performance, particularly with big media libraries, and solid integration with Urge, the company’s de facto music streaming service. Whenever Windows Media Player approaches the finish of a video, it gives you the option to repeat it manually, but it does not do it routinely.</p>
<p>Enabling the Repeat function, on the other hand, directs Media Player to play the video in a constant loop until you actively stop it or shut the software. Looping a video impacts the rest of the video from start to finish; Media Player does not only allow you to loop a portion of it but more.</p>
<p><strong>How to Loop Video in Windows Media Player?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Drag your mouse pointer over the Media Player window in <strong>Now Playing</strong> status to reveal the <em>playback settings</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> To continually repeat the movie, click the <strong>Turn Repeat On</strong> button, denoted by a circular arrow, and glows blue when toggled on.</p>
<p>(<strong>Note:</strong> If you don’t see this button in a tiny playing window, select the square <strong>Maximize</strong> symbol or drag the video corners to expand the window bigger).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Until you exit the application or click the <strong>Turn Repeat Off</strong> icon, the Repeat option will repeat the whole video.</p>

                ></p>
<p> <strong>Note:</strong> When you close the window, your prior feature selection is retained; thus, the next video you watch will play in a loop until you turn off the <strong>Repeat</strong> feature.</p>

You may also produce your videos and audio recordings and do rapid changes. Basic activities such as video flipping and clip splitting are included in edits.</p>
<p>You can record a screencast of a lecture, or capture a portion of the screen with QuickTime, which is ideal for creating a video lesson for an application. Using QuickTime, you may cut the length of video clips or merge many pieces into a single film. Drag the clips to a film window - QuickTime dynamically scales or trims them to fit the size of the movie.</p>
<p>It can also play your video on loop. Here’s how:</p>
<p><strong>How to Loop Video with QuickTime Player?</strong></p>
<p>If you’re using a Mac and wish to generate a video loop in QuickTime Player, follow these steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the <strong>QuickTime</strong> player to watch any video.</p>

<p>These two video programs simplify setting up videos to run on repeat; they don’t allow you to loop individual video parts. To do so, you’ll need more powerful software, such as the well-known VLC Media Player.</p>

The VLC player can operate on several operating systems, including Windows 2021, XP, and Mac OS X, because of the device’s powerful CPUs.</p>
<p>This makes the VLC Media Player an excellent alternative for anybody searching for a media player that can simultaneously run many programs. This free video editing program also includes special capabilities that allow it to execute numerous jobs simultaneously, including video editing, data transmission, graphic display, sound editing, and much more.</p>
<p> <strong>How to Loop a part of the Video in VLC Media Player Continuously?</strong></p>
<p>Create a beginning point A and an ending point B, which are in the center of VLC’s timeline. There is a control button for the A to B looping function in the Advanced Controls. The starting and ending positions inside a media file can be specified by bringing up the advanced controls first. Now follow these steps to put a video on loop in the VLC media player:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the video with VLC media player. Go to <strong>View</strong>. Select the <strong>Advanced Controls</strong> option.</p>

<p>Enabling the Repeat function, on the other hand, directs Media Player to play the video in a constant loop until you actively stop it or shut the software.

<p><strong>How to Loop Video in Windows Media Player?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Drag your mouse pointer over the Media Player window in <strong>Now Playing</strong> status to reveal the <em>playback settings</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> To continually repeat the movie, click the <strong>Turn Repeat On</strong> button, denoted by a circular arrow, and glows blue when toggled on.</p>
<p>(<strong>Note:</strong> If you don’t see this button in a tiny playing window, select the square <strong>Maximize</strong> symbol or drag the video corners to expand the window bigger).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Until you exit the application or click the <strong>Turn Repeat Off</strong> icon, the Repeat option will repeat the whole video.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Drag your mouse pointer over the Media Player window in <strong>Now Playing</strong> status to reveal the <em>playback settings</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> To continually repeat the movie, click the <strong>Turn Repeat On</strong> button, denoted by a circular arrow, and glows blue when toggled on.</p>
<p>(<strong>Note:</strong> If you don’t see this button in a tiny playing window, select the square <strong>Maximize</strong> symbol or drag the video corners to expand the window bigger).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Until you exit the application or click the <strong>Turn Repeat Off</strong> icon, the Repeat option will repeat the whole video.</p>

<p>Brightening an iPhone video can help you see the activity on-screen and make it more appealing if you share it on social media or post it to a website.</p>
<p>Because the iPhone’s built-in camera app does not enable you to brighten films after they have been recorded, you should always try to light a video before you begin recording.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Switch to video mode by opening the camera app and swiping left. Touch the screen to bring up a box with a sun-shaped symbol.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Move your fingers upward on the iPhone screen to brighten the scene when you begin filming. This may be done at any moment while the video is being recorded.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>There are a ton of <strong>Video Brightening Editor Apps</strong> that will make brightening the videos after filming quite easy for you. Long gone are the days when you had to re-film now and again until you would get that one final shot that has every color adjustment aspect fit to perfection. With the advent of amazing software such as those covered in this article, brightening a dark video has never been easier!</p>

<p>Finding a good video maker for Mac is not always easy – not for lack of options, there are many applications out there, but there are <strong>two main limitations</strong>: money, first and foremost, we all know how expensive video makers – good video makers – can be. The second limitation is complexity: sometimes you end up spending more time reading the help instead of editing, and the application you’ve chosen probably contains the features that you need – except that you have serious problems finding them on the menu.</p>

It supports pretty much any format you may think of (AVI, MP4, MOV, MPG, MKV, TRP, and so on), and it’s quite easy to use when it comes to the most basic features you’d expect in a video editor, such as cropping, joining, trimming, and rotating, as well as for adding some effects, transitions, and sound effects.</p>
<p>Because of that, Wondershare Filmora may actually be deceptively simple – because it’s capable of much more powerful features, if you take your time to study all its options, such as <strong>picture in picture, green screen</strong>, if you fancy yourself the next Hollywood director, adjustable playback speed, separation of the audio track from the original video file, tilt-shift effects, which can create very interesting results in a video, automatic noise reduction, and image enhancement, to bring back to life the subjects of the video, and automatic scene detection – allowing you to create a new video clip every time a scene changes. And there are a lot more things you can discover for yourself if you spend some time playing around.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora will also allow you to upload your creations directly to <strong>Facebook or YouTube</strong>, or to burn them on DVDs, so you can get straight into the next project without wasting any time.</p>

You may find it already installed on your Mac if you’ve just purchased a new machine. If not, it’s free to use after you purchase iLife.</p>
<p>It’s not the most powerful and complex application out there, as you can imagine for a piece of software that comes pre-installed, but it’s a good first stop for people who are just starting out in this field and need to learn the basics of editing videos on Mac without too many headaches.</p>
<p>It has many easy-to-use effects and lots of build-in animations, music samples, and sounds to get you started on your first project immediately.</p>
<p>Granted, iMovie has sacrificed a lot of features for the simplicity of use – sooner or later you’ll want to move on to something more complex, but, for beginners and for people who just need to add a few editing touches to a project here and there, this is a more than the reasonable solution. Don’t let yourself put off by the fact iMovie has a rather bad reputation online – of course, that very advanced users are disappointed by it, but you can use it for a while and you’ll know when it’s time to move on.</p>

If you’ve been struggling to get everything just perfect before, now you’ll have everything you need at your fingertips and you only need to unleash your imagination.

<p>Moreover, the community will always be there for you – if you have any questions or if you get stuck, you only need to post a question online and somebody will be there to help you out – not to mention the very large number of tutorials available online, with more being added almost daily.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure about this, you may want to start by searching online for clips created entirely with Blender. Of course, yours won’t be masterpieces from day one, it will take some time to get used to this application – but you’ll get some idea of how powerful it can be, and the level of mastery that you’ll want to achieve, eventually.</p>

<p>Finding a good video maker for Mac is not always easy – not for lack of options, there are many applications out there, but there are <strong>two main limitations</strong>: money, first and foremost, we all know how expensive video makers – good video makers – can be. The second limitation is complexity: sometimes you end up spending more time reading the help instead of editing, and the application you’ve chosen probably contains the features that you need – except that you have serious problems finding them on the menu.</p>
<p><a href="#part1">1. Wondershare Filmora Video Maker for Mac</a><br><a href="#part2">2. iMovie</a><br><a href="#part3">3. Blender</a></p>
<h2 id="Best-Video-Maker-for-Mac-3"><a href="#Best-Video-Maker-for-Mac-3" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Maker for Mac"></a>Best Video Maker for Mac</h2><p>Some video makers manage to stay on top by avoiding, or at least limiting these problems, and here are three of those.</p>
<h3 id="1-Vieo-Maker-on-Mac-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Maker-for-Mac-3"><a href="#1-Vieo-Maker-on-Mac-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Maker-for-Mac-3" class="headerlink" title="1.Vieo Maker on Mac: Wondershare Filmora Video Maker for Mac"></a>1.Vieo Maker on Mac: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Maker for Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Wondershare Filmora for Mac offers perhaps the best value for money (not to mention that it has a free version as well if you’d like to try it first. It supports pretty much any format you may think of (AVI, MP4, MOV, MPG, MKV, TRP, and so on), and it’s quite easy to use when it comes to the most basic features you’d expect in a video editor, such as cropping, joining, trimming, and rotating, as well as for adding some effects, transitions, and sound effects.</p>
<p>Because of that, Wondershare Filmora may actually be deceptively simple – because it’s capable of much more powerful features, if you take your time to study all its options, such as <strong>picture in picture, green screen</strong>, if you fancy yourself the next Hollywood director, adjustable playback speed, separation of the audio track from the original video file, tilt-shift effects, which can create very interesting results in a video, automatic noise reduction, and image enhancement, to bring back to life the subjects of the video, and automatic scene detection – allowing you to create a new video clip every time a scene changes. And there are a lot more things you can discover for yourself if you spend some time playing around.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora will also allow you to upload your creations directly to <strong>Facebook or YouTube</strong>, or to burn them on DVDs, so you can get straight into the next project without wasting any time.</p>
