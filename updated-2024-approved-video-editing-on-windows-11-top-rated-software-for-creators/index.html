<p>The popularity of video content on social media networks has been soaring in the last couple of years, and it is only reasonable to expect this trend to continue. Tutorials, promotional videos and various other types of videos for social media help companies run successful advertising campaigns and increase their profits. You don’t have to be a seasoned video editing professional in order to create videos for social networks, in fact, you can make viral videos even with entry-level video editing software, like iMovie or Avidemux. That’s the reason why in this article we are going to introduce you to 10+ best video editing apps you can use online, on Mac and PC computers or Smartphones.</p>

<h4 id="1-iMovie-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-macOS-and-iOS"><a href="#1-iMovie-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-macOS-and-iOS" class="headerlink" title="1. iMovie –Best Free Video Editing Software for Beginners on macOS and iOS"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/imovie/" >iMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> –Best Free Video Editing Software for Beginners on macOS and iOS</h4><p>Learning how to use iMovie to create videos for social media won’t take too much of your time, as the app’s intuitive interface makes performing all basic video editing actions look easy. iMovie lets you edit footage recorded in resolutions up to 4K and it features 10 high fidelity filters that enhance the colors in your videos. The app also lets you create PIP and split screen videos, alter the playback speed of a video clip or create engaging opening titles or end credits. The royalty-free music, sound effects or the voiceover recording feature can all help you create a perfect soundtrack for each video you edit in iMovie.</p>

The Photos App is equipped with a number of 3D effects and a rich collection of filters that can assist you in creating a distinctive visual style for each new video you edit with it.

Once you know what you want to accomplish you should <strong>acquire as much information as you possibly can about a video editing software</strong> in order to find out if the video editor you’re considering can help you accomplish your goal. The <strong>price</strong> is yet another factor you should consider since you don’t have to spend a lot of money on video editing software that takes years to master if you just want to create a promotional video for your company.</p>
<p>Besides the features, a video editing application offers, you should also <strong>try to find out how user-friendly its interface is</strong> and how <strong>comfortable or efficient</strong> you are while working on a project in a video editing software. <strong>Installing a trial version</strong> of a video editor might help you decide if that editor is the right choice for you. If you have absolutely no previous video editing experience, then it is best to start with a simple video editing app like iMovie or the Photos App and then switch to a more advanced video editor once you develop your video editing skills.</p>

Once you know what you want to accomplish you should <strong>acquire as much information as you possibly can about a video editing software</strong> in order to find out if the video editor you’re considering can help you accomplish your goal. The <strong>price</strong> is yet another factor you should consider since you don’t have to spend a lot of money on video editing software that takes years to master if you just want to create a promotional video for your company.</p>
<p>Besides the features, a video editing application offers, you should also <strong>try to find out how user-friendly its interface is</strong> and how <strong>comfortable or efficient</strong> you are while working on a project in a video editing software. <strong>Installing a trial version</strong> of a video editor might help you decide if that editor is the right choice for you. If you have absolutely no previous video editing experience, then it is best to start with a simple video editing app like iMovie or the Photos App and then switch to a more advanced video editor once you develop your video editing skills.</p>

<p>The popularity of video content on social media networks has been soaring in the last couple of years, and it is only reasonable to expect this trend to continue. Tutorials, promotional videos and various other types of videos for social media help companies run successful advertising campaigns and increase their profits. You don’t have to be a seasoned video editing professional in order to create videos for social networks, in fact, you can make viral videos even with entry-level video editing software, like iMovie or Avidemux. That’s the reason why in this article we are going to introduce you to 10+ best video editing apps you can use online, on Mac and PC computers or Smartphones.</p>

Let’s take a look at the free video editing options Mac and PC users have at their disposal in 2024.</p>
<h4 id="1-iMovie-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-macOS-and-iOS-2"><a href="#1-iMovie-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-macOS-and-iOS-2" class="headerlink" title="1. iMovie –Best Free Video Editing Software for Beginners on macOS and iOS"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/imovie/" >iMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> –Best Free Video Editing Software for Beginners on macOS and iOS</h4><p>Learning how to use iMovie to create videos for social media won’t take too much of your time, as the app’s intuitive interface makes performing all basic video editing actions look easy. iMovie lets you edit footage recorded in resolutions up to 4K and it features 10 high fidelity filters that enhance the colors in your videos. The app also lets you create PIP and split screen videos, alter the playback speed of a video clip or create engaging opening titles or end credits. The royalty-free music, sound effects or the voiceover recording feature can all help you create a perfect soundtrack for each video you edit in iMovie.</p>
<h4 id="2-Photos-App-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-Windows-10-2"><a href="#2-Photos-App-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-Windows-10-2" class="headerlink" title="2.

The app’s Edit&amp;Create menu offers Draw, Add slo-mo or Trim tools that allow you to draw over the source footage and remove unwanted pieces of video clips from the timeline. The Photos App is equipped with a number of 3D effects and a rich collection of filters that can assist you in creating a distinctive visual style for each new video you edit with it. However, the app’s exporting options are far from impressive, since you can’t export your projects to social media directly from the Photos App.</p>

Windows Movie Maker grants you access to a huge collection of transitions and visual effects and it makes the process of creating titles effortless. Certain options like video stabilization are only available on the version of the video editing software that is compatible with Windows 8, and the exact list of the tools provided by Windows Movie Maker varies on different versions of the Windows OS.</p>

<p>The popularity of video content on social media networks has been soaring in the last couple of years, and it is only reasonable to expect this trend to continue. Tutorials, promotional videos and various other types of videos for social media help companies run successful advertising campaigns and increase their profits. You don’t have to be a seasoned video editing professional in order to create videos for social networks, in fact, you can make viral videos even with entry-level video editing software, like iMovie or Avidemux. That’s the reason why in this article we are going to introduce you to 10+ best video editing apps you can use online, on Mac and PC computers or Smartphones.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Video-Editing-Software-for-Novice-Video-Content-Creators-in-2024-3"><a href="#Best-Video-Editing-Software-for-Novice-Video-Content-Creators-in-2024-3" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Editing Software for Novice Video Content Creators in 2024"></a>Best Video Editing Software for Novice Video Content Creators in 2024</h2><p>Anyone who has access to a computer that runs on a macOS or Windows OS can edit videos for free because both of these operating systems have built-in video editing software. Let’s take a look at the free video editing options Mac and PC users have at their disposal in 2024.</p>
<h4 id="1-iMovie-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-macOS-and-iOS-3"><a href="#1-iMovie-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-macOS-and-iOS-3" class="headerlink" title="1. iMovie –Best Free Video Editing Software for Beginners on macOS and iOS"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/imovie/" >iMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> –Best Free Video Editing Software for Beginners on macOS and iOS</h4><p>Learning how to use iMovie to create videos for social media won’t take too much of your time, as the app’s intuitive interface makes performing all basic video editing actions look easy. iMovie lets you edit footage recorded in resolutions up to 4K and it features 10 high fidelity filters that enhance the colors in your videos. The app also lets you create PIP and split screen videos, alter the playback speed of a video clip or create engaging opening titles or end credits. The royalty-free music, sound effects or the voiceover recording feature can all help you create a perfect soundtrack for each video you edit in iMovie.</p>
<h4 id="2-Photos-App-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-Windows-10-3"><a href="#2-Photos-App-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-Windows-10-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

The app’s Edit&amp;Create menu offers Draw, Add slo-mo or Trim tools that allow you to draw over the source footage and remove unwanted pieces of video clips from the timeline. The Photos App is equipped with a number of 3D effects and a rich collection of filters that can assist you in creating a distinctive visual style for each new video you edit with it. However, the app’s exporting options are far from impressive, since you can’t export your projects to social media directly from the Photos App.</p>
<h4 id="3-Windows-Movie-Maker-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-Windows-8-7-3"><a href="#3-Windows-Movie-Maker-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-Windows-8-7-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

Windows Movie Maker grants you access to a huge collection of transitions and visual effects and it makes the process of creating titles effortless. Certain options like video stabilization are only available on the version of the video editing software that is compatible with Windows 8, and the exact list of the tools provided by Windows Movie Maker varies on different versions of the Windows OS.</p>
<h4 id="4-Avidemux-–Best-Free-Open-Source-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-in-2020-3"><a href="#4-Avidemux-–Best-Free-Open-Source-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-in-2020-3" class="headerlink" title="4.

This open source video editor is compatible with Linux, macOS and Windows OS, which means that you can edit videos with it regardless of the computer you have. Avidemux supports nearly all video file formats, and it is a perfect choice for all video content creators who frequently shoot their videos on different cameras. Nonetheless, the number of video editing tools Avidemux offers is far from impressive which limits your options during the video editing process.</p>

<p>It is hard to believe that in 2024 Google Play had just fifty apps since it currently offers 2.8 million applications that can be used for anything from photo and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to learning a new language.</p>
<p>This year Google Play had a difficult task of selecting the best app of 2024, as there are so many apps across different categories that are worthy of this award. On December 3rd Google Play announced its choice and also presented the best Android apps of 2024 that were selected by users. So without further ado let’s take a look at the best and most popular Android apps of 2024</p>
<h2 id="The-Best-App-of-2024-Selected-by-Google-Play-Ablo-2"><a href="#The-Best-App-of-2024-Selected-by-Google-Play-Ablo-2" class="headerlink" title="The Best App of 2024 Selected by Google Play: Ablo"></a>The Best App of 2024 Selected by Google Play: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=live.ablo&hl=en" >Ablo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>Language barriers can prevent us from exploring the world and experiencing different cultures. So, it is no wonder that an app that enables its users to talk to people from around the globe in their mother tongue was chosen as the best app of 2024 by Google Play.</p>

                      alt=" 
Ablo: Make new friends from all over the world "
                ></p>
<p>Ablo translates all chat messages in real-time which enables you to talk with all likeminded people you meet even if you don’t speak the same language.</p>
<p>The app also translates video calls live and allows you to have meaningful conversations with friends that come from different parts of the world. If you are traveling often and looking for an easy way to encounter the local culture or you just want to communicate with people whose language you don’t understand, then you should install Ablo and start making friends around the world.</p>

Over the course of 2024 apps from a broad range of categories have sparked the interest of thousands of Android users. Here are some of the most popular apps of 2024 that can help you improve your productivity or make better fashion choices.</p>
<h3 id="1-Peloton-2"><a href="#1-Peloton-2" class="headerlink" title="1.

                      alt="InShot Video Editor - Glitch Video Effects "
                ></p>
<p>Leading a healthy lifestyle is much easier if you have the assistance of the world’s leading instructors. If you already own a Peloton bike or tread, then you can enjoy all the benefits of the Peloton app for free. Yoga, cardio or indoor cycling are just a few among numerous types of classes you can attend through this Android app. In addition, you can also broadcast your workouts through the Peloton’s Chromecast support and share your daily workout routines with thousands of followers. Even so, the app’s interface is somewhat outdated and the app crashes easily during workouts, which makes using Peloton frequently a bit difficult.</p>

<p>If you would like to keep track of the latest fashion trends and discover places where you can buy clothes and accessories worn by your favorite influencers, then you should install the 21 Buttons app on your phone. This social network for fashion enthusiasts can help you choose new outfits and save them in your public or private closets. What’s more, you can share the fashion choices with your followers and link to the stores where particular items can be purchased. This app also enables you to search for up and coming brands, since it is hard to find a fashion brand that isn’t featured on 21 Buttons.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Managing and organizing vast amounts of handwritten notes is a futile effort as sorting out hundreds of tiny pieces of paper is often impossible. Installing the Post-it app that captures handwritten notes and allows you to organize them in any way you want can help you perform your daily tasks more efficiently. Once you’ve created and organized your board you can share it with your colleagues or export it to Excel, PowerPoint or Trello. Post-it can capture more than 200 notes at the same time using your phone’s camera and use the Handwriting Recognition AI to transcribe them. Each not you create with this app can be easily edited or deleted.</p>

<h5 id="Richard-Bennett-3"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-3" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p>
<p>It is hard to believe that in 2024 Google Play had just fifty apps since it currently offers 2.8 million applications that can be used for anything from photo and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to learning a new language.</p>
<p>This year Google Play had a difficult task of selecting the best app of 2024, as there are so many apps across different categories that are worthy of this award. On December 3rd Google Play announced its choice and also presented the best Android apps of 2024 that were selected by users. So without further ado let’s take a look at the best and most popular Android apps of 2024</p>
<h2 id="The-Best-App-of-2024-Selected-by-Google-Play-Ablo-3"><a href="#The-Best-App-of-2024-Selected-by-Google-Play-Ablo-3" class="headerlink" title="The Best App of 2024 Selected by Google Play: Ablo"></a>The Best App of 2024 Selected by Google Play: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=live.ablo&hl=en" >Ablo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>Language barriers can prevent us from exploring the world and experiencing different cultures. So, it is no wonder that an app that enables its users to talk to people from around the globe in their mother tongue was chosen as the best app of 2024 by Google Play.</p>
<p><img

                      alt=" 
Ablo: Make new friends from all over the world "
                ></p>
<p>Ablo translates all chat messages in real-time which enables you to talk with all likeminded people you meet even if you don’t speak the same language.</p>
<p>The app also translates video calls live and allows you to have meaningful conversations with friends that come from different parts of the world. If you are traveling often and looking for an easy way to encounter the local culture or you just want to communicate with people whose language you don’t understand, then you should install Ablo and start making friends around the world.</p>
<h2 id="The-Most-Popular-Apps-of-2024-on-Google-Play-3"><a href="#The-Most-Popular-Apps-of-2024-on-Google-Play-3" class="headerlink" title="The Most Popular Apps of 2024 on Google Play"></a>The Most Popular Apps of 2024 on Google Play</h2><p>Smartphones bring entertainment to the palms of our hands and grant us instant access to information that makes our lives easier. Over the course of 2024 apps from a broad range of categories have sparked the interest of thousands of Android users. Here are some of the most popular apps of 2024 that can help you improve your productivity or make better fashion choices.</p>
<h3 id="1-Peloton-3"><a href="#1-Peloton-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Peloton"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onepeloton.callisto&hl=en" >Peloton <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>**Price:**Free, but offers in-app purchases</p>

                      alt="InShot Video Editor - Glitch Video Effects "
                ></p>
<p>Leading a healthy lifestyle is much easier if you have the assistance of the world’s leading instructors. If you already own a Peloton bike or tread, then you can enjoy all the benefits of the Peloton app for free. Yoga, cardio or indoor cycling are just a few among numerous types of classes you can attend through this Android app. In addition, you can also broadcast your workouts through the Peloton’s Chromecast support and share your daily workout routines with thousands of followers. Even so, the app’s interface is somewhat outdated and the app crashes easily during workouts, which makes using Peloton frequently a bit difficult.</p>

                ></p>
<p>If you would like to keep track of the latest fashion trends and discover places where you can buy clothes and accessories worn by your favorite influencers, then you should install the 21 Buttons app on your phone. This social network for fashion enthusiasts can help you choose new outfits and save them in your public or private closets. What’s more, you can share the fashion choices with your followers and link to the stores where particular items can be purchased. This app also enables you to search for up and coming brands, since it is hard to find a fashion brand that isn’t featured on 21 Buttons.</p>

                      alt="Most popular apps on Google Play - Post-it"
                ></p>
<p>Managing and organizing vast amounts of handwritten notes is a futile effort as sorting out hundreds of tiny pieces of paper is often impossible. Installing the Post-it app that captures handwritten notes and allows you to organize them in any way you want can help you perform your daily tasks more efficiently. Once you’ve created and organized your board you can share it with your colleagues or export it to Excel, PowerPoint or Trello. Post-it can capture more than 200 notes at the same time using your phone’s camera and use the Handwriting Recognition AI to transcribe them. Each not you create with this app can be easily edited or deleted.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Learning a new language should be a fun process that is not going to take too much of your time. Scripts by Drops limits the total amount of time you can spend practicing a new language to just five minutes a day. Even though this may seem far from enough to master Chinese Hanzi or to learn Russian Cyrillic, this app will deliver the results you’re looking for as long as you keep using it every single day. Scripts by Drops employs visual learning techniques that help the app’s users connect letters and characters to their pronunciations. If you opt for one of the available subscription models you will have an unlimited amount of learning time at your disposal.</p>

How to Use Stop Motion Studio?</h2><p>With the help of Stop Motion Studio, you can make animation by combining multiple pictures. You need to download Stop Motion Studio Pro for your iOS or Android device to use the app. You can also download it for PC.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="download stop motion studio"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1: Once you have downloaded the app, install it to work on your animation project right away. To create a new movie, click on the plus icon to create a new movie.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adding new movie in stop motion studio"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Set the object you wish to capture in the frame. Let us consider one example where we will turn over an object. Click the camera icon to capture the shot. Move the thing a little and again tap on the shutter icon. Repeat the process until you have moved it all the way around. Once done, click on the play button. It will appear as if the object is in motion and moving on its own.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="changing frame rate on stop motion studio"
                ></p>
<p>Tip: To ensure that your object is in the right place, you can use different controls like grid and onion skin. The grid will give you an idea of where you placed the subject in the frame. The onion skin puts the last frame you captured on top of your camera’s live view. In this way, you can see how far you moved your subject between frames.</p>
<p>Step 3: You can click as many pictures as you need to convey your story. After clicking all the pictures, you can edit them as per your requirements. To increase or decrease the speed at which your video plays, change the frame rate by choosing the number of pictures to be shown per second when you play the video. Play the video to see how your work turned out. If you like the end result, exit the editor.</p>
<p>Step 4: Now select the animation that you just saved. Click on the export icon which you will find at the top left of the screen—select animated GIF from the pulldown menu. Export the file to Google drive, mail yourself or upload it on your social media profile. AirDrop the file to other iPhone users if you are an iPhone user.</p>

How to Use Stop Motion Studio?</h2><p>With the help of Stop Motion Studio, you can make animation by combining multiple pictures. You need to download Stop Motion Studio Pro for your iOS or Android device to use the app. You can also download it for PC.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="download stop motion studio"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1: Once you have downloaded the app, install it to work on your animation project right away. To create a new movie, click on the plus icon to create a new movie.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adding new movie in stop motion studio"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Set the object you wish to capture in the frame. Let us consider one example where we will turn over an object. Click the camera icon to capture the shot. Move the thing a little and again tap on the shutter icon. Repeat the process until you have moved it all the way around. Once done, click on the play button. It will appear as if the object is in motion and moving on its own.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="changing frame rate on stop motion studio"
                ></p>
<p>Tip: To ensure that your object is in the right place, you can use different controls like grid and onion skin. The grid will give you an idea of where you placed the subject in the frame. The onion skin puts the last frame you captured on top of your camera’s live view. In this way, you can see how far you moved your subject between frames.</p>
<p>Step 3: You can click as many pictures as you need to convey your story. After clicking all the pictures, you can edit them as per your requirements. To increase or decrease the speed at which your video plays, change the frame rate by choosing the number of pictures to be shown per second when you play the video. Play the video to see how your work turned out. If you like the end result, exit the editor.</p>
<p>Step 4: Now select the animation that you just saved. Click on the export icon which you will find at the top left of the screen—select animated GIF from the pulldown menu. Export the file to Google drive, mail yourself or upload it on your social media profile. AirDrop the file to other iPhone users if you are an iPhone user.</p>
