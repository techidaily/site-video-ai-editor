<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>You can follow the step-by-step instructions that are given below to learn how to add 3D effects to a video with Wondershare Filmora:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import Source Video and Add It to the Timeline</strong></p>
<p>After installing Wondershare Filmora on Windows 10 or Windows 11, launch the program, click anywhere inside the Media box present at the upper-left section of the interface, and locate and import the source video to the program. Next, hover the mouse over the thumbnail of the video, click the <strong>+</strong> icon from the bottom-right corner.</p>
<p>When the confirmation box appears, either click <strong>Match to Media</strong> or <strong>Keep Project Settings</strong> to adjust the project settings according to the media clip or modify the media clip according to the project preferences while adding the footage to the Timeline respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add 3D Titles and Transitions</strong></p>
<p>Click <strong>Titles</strong> from the toolbox at the top, type <strong>3D Titles</strong> in the <strong>Search titles</strong> field present at the upper section of the upper-left box, and click <strong>3D titles</strong> from the suggestions list.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-3d-title-effects-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="find 3d title effects filmora"
                ></p>
<p>From all the available 3D title presets that appear next, drag the one you like to the Timeline, and place it above the video track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-title-effects-to-video-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="add 3d title effects to video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>After this, double-click the placeholder text in the <strong>Preview</strong> window, and replace it with your caption. You can customize the font, color, and alignment of the text from the options that appear on left. Click <strong>OK</strong> from the lower-left area of the left pane to exit the editing mode. Repeat the process for all the texts that the preset has. Optionally, drag the sides of the 3D title in the Timeline to specify its duration of visibility on the screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-3d-title-effects-in-video-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="edit 3d title effects in video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>To add the transitions, click <strong>Media</strong> from the toolbox at the top, click <strong>Import Media</strong> from the <strong>Media</strong> box, and repeat the process explained earlier to add a new video clip to the Timeline. Make sure that both the clips are on the same track, and are placed next to each other. Now, go to <strong>Transitions</strong> from the toolbox, and drag and place your preferred transition effect between the two media clips in the Timeline. Optionally you can drag the sides of the transition inwards or outwards to increase or decrease the speed of the effect respectively.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-transition-effects-to-video-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="add 3d transition effects to video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>After this, move the <strong>Playhead</strong> (<strong>Skimmer</strong>) to the beginning of the Timeline, and press the <strong>Spacebar</strong> on your keyboard to preview the video.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is a good practice to preview your video several times during the entire editing process. This will help you identify the error sooner, and you will be able to address the issue with fewer hassles.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Elements and Effects</strong></p>
<p>Go to <strong>Elements</strong> from the toolbox, drag your preferred element from the upper-left box to the Timeline, and place it on a new track. You can drag the sides of the element in the Timeline to increase or decrease its visibility during video playback.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-elements-to-video-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="add 3d elements to video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>To add effects, go to <strong>Effects</strong> from the toolbox, drag your preferred effect from the upper-left box, and place it on a new layer in the Timeline. As it is with other entities, you can drag the sides of the effect to increase or decrease the duration of its impact on the video. Next, double-click the <strong>Effects</strong> layer in the Timeline, and use the available options in the box to make further adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The options that you get by double-clicking the effect in the Timeline may vary according to the adjustments it allows you to make.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-effects-to-video-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="add 3d effects to video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Once this is done, preview the video, click <strong>Export</strong> from the top-center, and use the tabs and options on the <strong>Export</strong> box to export the modified video in your preferred format.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>If you are new to the VFX and video editing industry, trying hands with the Photos app would give you a fair idea about how things work. Once you are well-versed or if you are already a post-production professional, you can and you must go for a dedicated program like Wondershare Filmora that not only has an intuitive interface, it is also equipped with a plethora of presets to add 3D titles, elements, transitions, and effects to the videos without much hassle.</p>

<p>You can follow the step-by-step instructions that are given below to learn how to add 3D effects to a video with Wondershare Filmora:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import Source Video and Add It to the Timeline</strong></p>
<p>After installing Wondershare Filmora on Windows 10 or Windows 11, launch the program, click anywhere inside the Media box present at the upper-left section of the interface, and locate and import the source video to the program. Next, hover the mouse over the thumbnail of the video, click the <strong>+</strong> icon from the bottom-right corner.</p>
<p>When the confirmation box appears, either click <strong>Match to Media</strong> or <strong>Keep Project Settings</strong> to adjust the project settings according to the media clip or modify the media clip according to the project preferences while adding the footage to the Timeline respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add 3D Titles and Transitions</strong></p>
<p>Click <strong>Titles</strong> from the toolbox at the top, type <strong>3D Titles</strong> in the <strong>Search titles</strong> field present at the upper section of the upper-left box, and click <strong>3D titles</strong> from the suggestions list.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="find 3d title effects filmora"
                ></p>
<p>From all the available 3D title presets that appear next, drag the one you like to the Timeline, and place it above the video track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add 3d title effects to video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>After this, double-click the placeholder text in the <strong>Preview</strong> window, and replace it with your caption. You can customize the font, color, and alignment of the text from the options that appear on left. Click <strong>OK</strong> from the lower-left area of the left pane to exit the editing mode. Repeat the process for all the texts that the preset has. Optionally, drag the sides of the 3D title in the Timeline to specify its duration of visibility on the screen.</p>

                ></p>
<p>To add the transitions, click <strong>Media</strong> from the toolbox at the top, click <strong>Import Media</strong> from the <strong>Media</strong> box, and repeat the process explained earlier to add a new video clip to the Timeline. Make sure that both the clips are on the same track, and are placed next to each other. Now, go to <strong>Transitions</strong> from the toolbox, and drag and place your preferred transition effect between the two media clips in the Timeline. Optionally you can drag the sides of the transition inwards or outwards to increase or decrease the speed of the effect respectively.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>After this, move the <strong>Playhead</strong> (<strong>Skimmer</strong>) to the beginning of the Timeline, and press the <strong>Spacebar</strong> on your keyboard to preview the video.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is a good practice to preview your video several times during the entire editing process. This will help you identify the error sooner, and you will be able to address the issue with fewer hassles.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Elements and Effects</strong></p>
<p>Go to <strong>Elements</strong> from the toolbox, drag your preferred element from the upper-left box to the Timeline, and place it on a new track. You can drag the sides of the element in the Timeline to increase or decrease its visibility during video playback.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="add 3d elements to video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>To add effects, go to <strong>Effects</strong> from the toolbox, drag your preferred effect from the upper-left box, and place it on a new layer in the Timeline. As it is with other entities, you can drag the sides of the effect to increase or decrease the duration of its impact on the video. Next, double-click the <strong>Effects</strong> layer in the Timeline, and use the available options in the box to make further adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The options that you get by double-clicking the effect in the Timeline may vary according to the adjustments it allows you to make.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add 3d effects to video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Once this is done, preview the video, click <strong>Export</strong> from the top-center, and use the tabs and options on the <strong>Export</strong> box to export the modified video in your preferred format.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>If you are new to the VFX and video editing industry, trying hands with the Photos app would give you a fair idea about how things work. Once you are well-versed or if you are already a post-production professional, you can and you must go for a dedicated program like Wondershare Filmora that not only has an intuitive interface, it is also equipped with a plethora of presets to add 3D titles, elements, transitions, and effects to the videos without much hassle.</p>

<p>Optionally use the <strong>Volume</strong> slider from the right pane to increase or decrease the sound volume of the effect to blend it in with the audio of the footage. If required, drag the side handles of the effect in the progress bar at the bottom to increase or decrease the duration of the effect in the video.</p>

Wondershare Filmora is a post-production application for both Windows and Mac computers, and is considered a good competitor of some of the industry-standard video editing applications like Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro X, DaVinci Resolve, etc.</p>
<p>While the Photos app can add 3D effects to the videos quickly, Filmora gives more control by offering a plethora of editing tools, options, and presets. In addition, Filmora is a timeline-oriented tool that allows you to add effects, filters, and&#x2F;or elements in their corresponding layers without making any changes to the original footage.</p>

<p>You can follow the step-by-step instructions that are given below to learn how to add 3D effects to a video with Wondershare Filmora:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import Source Video and Add It to the Timeline</strong></p>
<p>After installing Wondershare Filmora on Windows 10 or Windows 11, launch the program, click anywhere inside the Media box present at the upper-left section of the interface, and locate and import the source video to the program. Next, hover the mouse over the thumbnail of the video, click the <strong>+</strong> icon from the bottom-right corner.</p>
<p>When the confirmation box appears, either click <strong>Match to Media</strong> or <strong>Keep Project Settings</strong> to adjust the project settings according to the media clip or modify the media clip according to the project preferences while adding the footage to the Timeline respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add 3D Titles and Transitions</strong></p>
<p>Click <strong>Titles</strong> from the toolbox at the top, type <strong>3D Titles</strong> in the <strong>Search titles</strong> field present at the upper section of the upper-left box, and click <strong>3D titles</strong> from the suggestions list.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-3d-title-effects-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="find 3d title effects filmora"
                ></p>
<p>From all the available 3D title presets that appear next, drag the one you like to the Timeline, and place it above the video track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-title-effects-to-video-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="add 3d title effects to video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>After this, double-click the placeholder text in the <strong>Preview</strong> window, and replace it with your caption. You can customize the font, color, and alignment of the text from the options that appear on left. Click <strong>OK</strong> from the lower-left area of the left pane to exit the editing mode. Repeat the process for all the texts that the preset has. Optionally, drag the sides of the 3D title in the Timeline to specify its duration of visibility on the screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-3d-title-effects-in-video-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="edit 3d title effects in video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>To add the transitions, click <strong>Media</strong> from the toolbox at the top, click <strong>Import Media</strong> from the <strong>Media</strong> box, and repeat the process explained earlier to add a new video clip to the Timeline. Make sure that both the clips are on the same track, and are placed next to each other. Now, go to <strong>Transitions</strong> from the toolbox, and drag and place your preferred transition effect between the two media clips in the Timeline. Optionally you can drag the sides of the transition inwards or outwards to increase or decrease the speed of the effect respectively.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-transition-effects-to-video-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="add 3d transition effects to video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>After this, move the <strong>Playhead</strong> (<strong>Skimmer</strong>) to the beginning of the Timeline, and press the <strong>Spacebar</strong> on your keyboard to preview the video.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is a good practice to preview your video several times during the entire editing process. This will help you identify the error sooner, and you will be able to address the issue with fewer hassles.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Elements and Effects</strong></p>
<p>Go to <strong>Elements</strong> from the toolbox, drag your preferred element from the upper-left box to the Timeline, and place it on a new track. You can drag the sides of the element in the Timeline to increase or decrease its visibility during video playback.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-elements-to-video-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="add 3d elements to video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>To add effects, go to <strong>Effects</strong> from the toolbox, drag your preferred effect from the upper-left box, and place it on a new layer in the Timeline. As it is with other entities, you can drag the sides of the effect to increase or decrease the duration of its impact on the video. Next, double-click the <strong>Effects</strong> layer in the Timeline, and use the available options in the box to make further adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The options that you get by double-clicking the effect in the Timeline may vary according to the adjustments it allows you to make.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-effects-to-video-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="add 3d effects to video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Once this is done, preview the video, click <strong>Export</strong> from the top-center, and use the tabs and options on the <strong>Export</strong> box to export the modified video in your preferred format.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>If you are new to the VFX and video editing industry, trying hands with the Photos app would give you a fair idea about how things work. Once you are well-versed or if you are already a post-production professional, you can and you must go for a dedicated program like Wondershare Filmora that not only has an intuitive interface, it is also equipped with a plethora of presets to add 3D titles, elements, transitions, and effects to the videos without much hassle.</p>

<h2 id="Getting-Started"><a href="#Getting-Started" class="headerlink" title="Getting Started"></a>Getting Started</h2><p>First, the best thing you can do to improve the quality of your keys is to improve how you shoot them. Here are seven basic production rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actors should be at least 10 feet in front of the green screen. This avoids light from the background “spilling” around their body or shoulders.</li>
<li>In general, don’t cast shadows on the green screen. Be very careful shooting feet.</li>
<li>The green background should be as smooth as possible. Paint is always better than fabric; avoid wrinkles and folds.</li>
<li>The green background should be lit smoothly, both from side to side and top to bottom. I try to have the green background display between 40-50% level on the waveform monitor.</li>
<li>There is NO relationship between how the background is lit and how your actors are lit. This article will illustrate that.</li>
<li>Light your background for smoothness. Light your actors for drama.</li>
<li>Don’t worry about having the green background fill the frame. It only needs to completely surround the edges of your actors. Garbage mattes are used to get rid of junk around the edges.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Setting-up-the-Key"><a href="#Setting-up-the-Key" class="headerlink" title="Setting up the Key"></a>Setting up the Key</h2><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-01.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 01"
                ></p>
<p>The green screen image is always placed above the background. You can place either the green screen or background image into the Primary Storyline. I find it easier to put the background in the Primary Storyline, because it makes editing the green screen image easier. But this is purely personal choice.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Select the green screen clip</strong></p>
<p>From the <strong>Effects Browser &gt; Keying</strong> category, double-click the <strong>Keyer</strong> effect, which applies it to the selected clip. (You can also drag the effect on top of the clip, if you forgot to select the green-screen clip first.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-02.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 02"
                ></p>
<p>Don’t panic if your image looks weird – we will fix it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-03.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 03"
                ></p>
<p>Click the <strong>Sample Color</strong> icon. This allows fine-tuning the selection of the background color.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="fx chroma 04"
                ></p>
<p>In the green-screen image, drag to select a representative section of the background. I try to get close to the face, but not so close that I accidentally select loose hair or skin.</p>
<p>Your key should look better immediately. Most of the time, you can probably stop here. But there are three other adjustments that can make your key look even better:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleaning up the matte</li>
<li>Edge adjustments</li>
<li>Light wrap</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-06.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 06"
                ></p>
<p>Click the <strong>Matte</strong> button to display your key as a white foreground on a black background.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-07.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 07"
                ></p>
<p>Your goal is the make the foreground solid white, which means opaque, and the background solid black, which means transparent. Adjust the <strong>Fill Holes</strong> and <strong>Edge Distance</strong> sliders until your key looks solid. (For REALLY bad keys, you’ll need to also adjust Color Selection, mentioned below.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-05.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 05"
                ></p>
<p>If an edge is too pronounced, or needs help, click the <strong>Edges</strong> icon.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-09.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 09"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Tweaks Video</strong></p>
<p>Then, click and drag a line from the foreground to the background in the Canvas. Drag the midpoint slider (where my cursor is) until the edge looks the best it can. Different video formats make this easy (ProRes), while others (HDV, avchd) make this much harder. Perfection is impossible – do the best you can.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-09a.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 09a"
                ></p>
<p>Final Cut provides four additional tweaks at the bottom of the keyer filter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Color Selection</li>
<li>Matte Tools</li>
<li>Spill Suppression</li>
<li>Light Wrap</li>
</ul>
<p>The first three are designed to clean up poorly shot keys – read the FCP X Help files to learn how these work. (I used the Color Selection tools to clean up the very dark key I use an example later in this article.)</p>
<p>Light wrap, though, is aesthetic. What it does is blend colors from the background into the edges of the foreground, to make the entire key look more “organic,” as if the foreground and background were actually in the same space.</p>
<p>This is a subtle effect, but very cool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-10.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 10"
                ></p>
<p>Twirl down Light Wrap and adjust the Amount slider and watch what happens. Drag the other sliders around and see what happens. The nice thing about this setting is that when it looks good to you, it is good. The amount of the effect is totally up to you. Remember, Light Wrap only affects the edges of the foreground and should be used subtly.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, you don’t have, ah, perhaps, the best green-screen image to work with. Here, for example, there are lighting instruments in the foreground, with a very inadequately lit green screen in the background. (Sigh… this is just pitiful.)</p>
<p>Once you pull the key – which is film-speak for creating a green-screen shot, as I described above – and get it looking as good as possible, there’s one more step: adding a garbage matte to get rid of all the garbage surrounding your actors.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Once you get your key looking as good as you can – which in this case isn’t all that good – drag the Mask effect (<strong>Effects &gt; Keying &gt; Mask</strong>) on top of the green-screen clip.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The Mask effect should always be added after the Keying effect, so that the Mask is below the Keyer in the Inspector.</p>

                      alt="fx chroma 14"
                ></p>
<p>Then, drag each of the four circles to create a shape such that your foreground image is contained inside it, and everything you want to exclude is outside. Here, for instance, we removed the light stand, the edge of the green background and the tearing at the top of the image. I’ve found this Mask effect works best when applied to a connected clip.</p>
<p>However, the big limitation of the Mask effect is that you only have four points to work with. That’s where a free effect comes in, which allows you to create far more flexible shapes with it. It’s written by Alex Gollner and is available on his website – alex4d.wordpress.com&#x2F;fcpx&#x2F; – I recommend his effects highly.</p>

<h2 id="Getting-Started-1"><a href="#Getting-Started-1" class="headerlink" title="Getting Started"></a>Getting Started</h2><p>First, the best thing you can do to improve the quality of your keys is to improve how you shoot them. Here are seven basic production rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actors should be at least 10 feet in front of the green screen. This avoids light from the background “spilling” around their body or shoulders.</li>
<li>In general, don’t cast shadows on the green screen. Be very careful shooting feet.</li>
<li>The green background should be as smooth as possible. Paint is always better than fabric; avoid wrinkles and folds.</li>
<li>The green background should be lit smoothly, both from side to side and top to bottom. I try to have the green background display between 40-50% level on the waveform monitor.</li>
<li>There is NO relationship between how the background is lit and how your actors are lit. This article will illustrate that.</li>
<li>Light your background for smoothness. Light your actors for drama.</li>
<li>Don’t worry about having the green background fill the frame. It only needs to completely surround the edges of your actors. Garbage mattes are used to get rid of junk around the edges.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Setting-up-the-Key-1"><a href="#Setting-up-the-Key-1" class="headerlink" title="Setting up the Key"></a>Setting up the Key</h2><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-01.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 01"
                ></p>
<p>The green screen image is always placed above the background. You can place either the green screen or background image into the Primary Storyline. I find it easier to put the background in the Primary Storyline, because it makes editing the green screen image easier. But this is purely personal choice.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Select the green screen clip</strong></p>
<p>From the <strong>Effects Browser &gt; Keying</strong> category, double-click the <strong>Keyer</strong> effect, which applies it to the selected clip. (You can also drag the effect on top of the clip, if you forgot to select the green-screen clip first.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-02.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 02"
                ></p>
<p>Don’t panic if your image looks weird – we will fix it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-03.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 03"
                ></p>
<p>Click the <strong>Sample Color</strong> icon. This allows fine-tuning the selection of the background color.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-04.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 04"
                ></p>
<p>In the green-screen image, drag to select a representative section of the background. I try to get close to the face, but not so close that I accidentally select loose hair or skin.</p>
<p>Your key should look better immediately. Most of the time, you can probably stop here. But there are three other adjustments that can make your key look even better:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleaning up the matte</li>
<li>Edge adjustments</li>
<li>Light wrap</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-06.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 06"
                ></p>
<p>Click the <strong>Matte</strong> button to display your key as a white foreground on a black background.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-07.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 07"
                ></p>
<p>Your goal is the make the foreground solid white, which means opaque, and the background solid black, which means transparent. Adjust the <strong>Fill Holes</strong> and <strong>Edge Distance</strong> sliders until your key looks solid. (For REALLY bad keys, you’ll need to also adjust Color Selection, mentioned below.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-05.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 05"
                ></p>
<p>If an edge is too pronounced, or needs help, click the <strong>Edges</strong> icon.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-09.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 09"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Tweaks Video</strong></p>
<p>Then, click and drag a line from the foreground to the background in the Canvas. Drag the midpoint slider (where my cursor is) until the edge looks the best it can. Different video formats make this easy (ProRes), while others (HDV, avchd) make this much harder. Perfection is impossible – do the best you can.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-09a.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 09a"
                ></p>
<p>Final Cut provides four additional tweaks at the bottom of the keyer filter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Color Selection</li>
<li>Matte Tools</li>
<li>Spill Suppression</li>
<li>Light Wrap</li>
</ul>
<p>The first three are designed to clean up poorly shot keys – read the FCP X Help files to learn how these work. (I used the Color Selection tools to clean up the very dark key I use an example later in this article.)</p>
<p>Light wrap, though, is aesthetic. What it does is blend colors from the background into the edges of the foreground, to make the entire key look more “organic,” as if the foreground and background were actually in the same space.</p>
<p>This is a subtle effect, but very cool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-10.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 10"
                ></p>
<p>Twirl down Light Wrap and adjust the Amount slider and watch what happens. Drag the other sliders around and see what happens. The nice thing about this setting is that when it looks good to you, it is good. The amount of the effect is totally up to you. Remember, Light Wrap only affects the edges of the foreground and should be used subtly.</p>

                     lazyload

<h2 id="Getting-Started-2"><a href="#Getting-Started-2" class="headerlink" title="Getting Started"></a>Getting Started</h2><p>First, the best thing you can do to improve the quality of your keys is to improve how you shoot them. Here are seven basic production rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actors should be at least 10 feet in front of the green screen. This avoids light from the background “spilling” around their body or shoulders.</li>
<li>In general, don’t cast shadows on the green screen. Be very careful shooting feet.</li>
<li>The green background should be as smooth as possible. Paint is always better than fabric; avoid wrinkles and folds.</li>
<li>The green background should be lit smoothly, both from side to side and top to bottom. I try to have the green background display between 40-50% level on the waveform monitor.</li>
<li>There is NO relationship between how the background is lit and how your actors are lit. This article will illustrate that.</li>
<li>Light your background for smoothness. Light your actors for drama.</li>
<li>Don’t worry about having the green background fill the frame. It only needs to completely surround the edges of your actors. Garbage mattes are used to get rid of junk around the edges.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Setting-up-the-Key-2"><a href="#Setting-up-the-Key-2" class="headerlink" title="Setting up the Key"></a>Setting up the Key</h2><p><img

                ></p>
<p>The green screen image is always placed above the background. You can place either the green screen or background image into the Primary Storyline. I find it easier to put the background in the Primary Storyline, because it makes editing the green screen image easier. But this is purely personal choice.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Select the green screen clip</strong></p>
<p>From the <strong>Effects Browser &gt; Keying</strong> category, double-click the <strong>Keyer</strong> effect, which applies it to the selected clip. (You can also drag the effect on top of the clip, if you forgot to select the green-screen clip first.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="fx chroma 02"
                ></p>
<p>Don’t panic if your image looks weird – we will fix it.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="fx chroma 03"
                ></p>
<p>Click the <strong>Sample Color</strong> icon. This allows fine-tuning the selection of the background color.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="fx chroma 04"
                ></p>
<p>In the green-screen image, drag to select a representative section of the background. I try to get close to the face, but not so close that I accidentally select loose hair or skin.</p>
<p>Your key should look better immediately. Most of the time, you can probably stop here. But there are three other adjustments that can make your key look even better:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleaning up the matte</li>
<li>Edge adjustments</li>
<li>Light wrap</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-06.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 06"
                ></p>
<p>Click the <strong>Matte</strong> button to display your key as a white foreground on a black background.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-07.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 07"
                ></p>
<p>Your goal is the make the foreground solid white, which means opaque, and the background solid black, which means transparent. Adjust the <strong>Fill Holes</strong> and <strong>Edge Distance</strong> sliders until your key looks solid. (For REALLY bad keys, you’ll need to also adjust Color Selection, mentioned below.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-05.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 05"
                ></p>
<p>If an edge is too pronounced, or needs help, click the <strong>Edges</strong> icon.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="fx chroma 09"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Tweaks Video</strong></p>
<p>Then, click and drag a line from the foreground to the background in the Canvas. Drag the midpoint slider (where my cursor is) until the edge looks the best it can. Different video formats make this easy (ProRes), while others (HDV, avchd) make this much harder. Perfection is impossible – do the best you can.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-09a.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 09a"
                ></p>
<p>Final Cut provides four additional tweaks at the bottom of the keyer filter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Color Selection</li>
<li>Matte Tools</li>
<li>Spill Suppression</li>
<li>Light Wrap</li>
</ul>
<p>The first three are designed to clean up poorly shot keys – read the FCP X Help files to learn how these work. (I used the Color Selection tools to clean up the very dark key I use an example later in this article.)</p>
<p>Light wrap, though, is aesthetic. What it does is blend colors from the background into the edges of the foreground, to make the entire key look more “organic,” as if the foreground and background were actually in the same space.</p>
<p>This is a subtle effect, but very cool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-10.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 10"
                ></p>
<p>Twirl down Light Wrap and adjust the Amount slider and watch what happens. Drag the other sliders around and see what happens. The nice thing about this setting is that when it looks good to you, it is good. The amount of the effect is totally up to you. Remember, Light Wrap only affects the edges of the foreground and should be used subtly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-11.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 11"
                ></p>
<p>When you are done, you have a great looking key!</p>
<h2 id="Clean-up-the-Image-with-a-Garbage-Mask-2"><a href="#Clean-up-the-Image-with-a-Garbage-Mask-2" class="headerlink" title="Clean up the Image with a Garbage Mask"></a>Clean up the Image with a Garbage Mask</h2><p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="fx chroma 12"
                ></p>
<p>Sometimes, however, you don’t have, ah, perhaps, the best green-screen image to work with. Here, for example, there are lighting instruments in the foreground, with a very inadequately lit green screen in the background. (Sigh… this is just pitiful.)</p>
<p>Once you pull the key – which is film-speak for creating a green-screen shot, as I described above – and get it looking as good as possible, there’s one more step: adding a garbage matte to get rid of all the garbage surrounding your actors.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-13.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 13"
                ></p>
<p>Once you get your key looking as good as you can – which in this case isn’t all that good – drag the Mask effect (<strong>Effects &gt; Keying &gt; Mask</strong>) on top of the green-screen clip.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The Mask effect should always be added after the Keying effect, so that the Mask is below the Keyer in the Inspector.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-14.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 14"
                ></p>
<p>Then, drag each of the four circles to create a shape such that your foreground image is contained inside it, and everything you want to exclude is outside. Here, for instance, we removed the light stand, the edge of the green background and the tearing at the top of the image. I’ve found this Mask effect works best when applied to a connected clip.</p>
<p>However, the big limitation of the Mask effect is that you only have four points to work with. That’s where a free effect comes in, which allows you to create far more flexible shapes with it. It’s written by Alex Gollner and is available on his website – alex4d.wordpress.com&#x2F;fcpx&#x2F; – I recommend his effects highly.</p>

<p>Final Cut provides four additional tweaks at the bottom of the keyer filter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Color Selection</li>
<li>Matte Tools</li>
<li>Spill Suppression</li>
<li>Light Wrap</li>
</ul>
<p>The first three are designed to clean up poorly shot keys – read the FCP X Help files to learn how these work. (I used the Color Selection tools to clean up the very dark key I use an example later in this article.)</p>
<p>Light wrap, though, is aesthetic. What it does is blend colors from the background into the edges of the foreground, to make the entire key look more “organic,” as if the foreground and background were actually in the same space.</p>
<p>This is a subtle effect, but very cool.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="fx chroma 10"
                ></p>
<p>Twirl down Light Wrap and adjust the Amount slider and watch what happens. Drag the other sliders around and see what happens. The nice thing about this setting is that when it looks good to you, it is good. The amount of the effect is totally up to you. Remember, Light Wrap only affects the edges of the foreground and should be used subtly.</p>

<p>When you are done, you have a great looking key!</p>

                ></p>
<p>Sometimes, however, you don’t have, ah, perhaps, the best green-screen image to work with. Here, for example, there are lighting instruments in the foreground, with a very inadequately lit green screen in the background. (Sigh… this is just pitiful.)</p>
<p>Once you pull the key – which is film-speak for creating a green-screen shot, as I described above – and get it looking as good as possible, there’s one more step: adding a garbage matte to get rid of all the garbage surrounding your actors.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="fx chroma 13"
                ></p>
<p>Once you get your key looking as good as you can – which in this case isn’t all that good – drag the Mask effect (<strong>Effects &gt; Keying &gt; Mask</strong>) on top of the green-screen clip.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The Mask effect should always be added after the Keying effect, so that the Mask is below the Keyer in the Inspector.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="fx chroma 14"
                ></p>
<p>Then, drag each of the four circles to create a shape such that your foreground image is contained inside it, and everything you want to exclude is outside. Here, for instance, we removed the light stand, the edge of the green background and the tearing at the top of the image. I’ve found this Mask effect works best when applied to a connected clip.</p>
<p>However, the big limitation of the Mask effect is that you only have four points to work with. That’s where a free effect comes in, which allows you to create far more flexible shapes with it. It’s written by Alex Gollner and is available on his website – alex4d.wordpress.com&#x2F;fcpx&#x2F; – I recommend his effects highly.</p>

                ></p>
<p>1. The Social Network (2010)</p>
<p>Based on the rise of the phenomenon that we now know as Facebook, The Social Network starred Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake. The movie performed well at the box office and was also positively received by movie critics.</p>
<p>The film won an Academy Award for Best Editing, collected by Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall. They used Final Cut Pro to edit the film, and one of the things they really like about the software is the ability to do multiple timelines. Final Cut Pro was also used in this movie to enable face replacement in a number of scenes. Two of the key characters in the movie are twins, and so the scenes were filmed with actors (who weren’t twins) and then the editing software was used to create the illusion that they were twins. Digital matte paintings was another feature of this movie that relied on the functionality of Final Cut Pro.</p>

                ></p>
<p>2. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)</p>
<p>This was the US adaptation of the earlier Swedish film of the same name - based on the novel by Stieg Larsson. Starring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, the story is a crime thriller trying to uncover the secrets surrounding the disappearance of a young girl from a wealthy family.</p>
<p>One of the challenges with this movie was that there were a lot of invisible effects throughout the film. Final Cut Pro was used to achieve the shot stabilization and the visual enhancements - everything from matte painting to creating seasonal elements such as snow.</p>

                ></p>
<p>3. John Carter (2011)</p>
<p>A science fiction adventure, this film performed so badly at the box office that it caused major financial problems for its studio Disney.</p>
<p>The editing of the John Carter movie was a particular challenge as a lot of the action was shot twice during the troubled production. The editor Eric Zumbrunnen used Final Cut Pro to piece the various elements together. With a huge range of CGI and creature effects to deal with, the editing process on this movie was extremely complex. Final Cut Pro was used to create a lot of the background detail need to bring the green screen scenes to life.</p>

<p>4. 500 Days of Summer (2009)</p>
<p>This was a cute, quirky romantic comedy starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Alan Edward Bell in DVCPro HD format on Final Cut Pro. Because the storyline of the movie unfolds in a non-linear timeline, the workflow feature of Final Cut Pro made it easier to manage the sequencing of the different scenes. There were also 250 invisible effects which were created using Final Cut Pro’s editing features.</p>

                ></p>
<p>5. X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)</p>
<p>Continuing the X-Men franchise, this installment traces Wolverine’s childhood and the relationship with his brother. It didn’t really appeal to X-Men fans or movie critics.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Nicolas De Toth and Megan Gill. There were a number of continuity glitches identified during the production of this movie but De Toth and Gill used Final Pro Cut to keep a consistent flow to the narrative. What is interesting about the editing on this movie is that all the cutting of the scenes required was done on Final Cut Pro 5, taking advantage of the software’s HD abilities and also the multi-clip features.</p>

                ></p>
<p>6. Burn After Reading (2008)</p>
<p>A black comedy from the talented brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, they wrote, produced, edited, and directed the movie.</p>
<p>The Coen brothers used Final Cut Pro on this movie because it was simple and easy to use - they were blocking together the rough cuts as the scenes were being shot, and Final Cut Pro gave them the flexibility that they needed to edit quickly. On this movie most of the action was shot using Sony cameras but there were several scenes on which a RED camera was added when an additional camera was needed. Even though there is a significantly different workflow between the two types of camera, the RED material was able to be integrated smoothly with the Sony footage.</p>

                ></p>
<p>7. No Country for Old Men (2007)</p>
<p>A neo-Western thriller from Coen brothers. They directed, wrote, and edited this production.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing for editor Roderick Jaynes (a pseudonym for Joel and Ethan Coen).</p>
<p>Directing and editing a movie brings the two processes a lot closer together for the Coen brothers. An easy to use product such as Final Cut Pro ensures that they can construct the movie’s narrative using the timeline features of the product. This movie marked a chance in approach for the Coen brothers, who took advantage of the better resolution DVCPRO HD for their cutting process compared to earlier films that were cut at DV resolution.</p>

<p>8. 300 (2007)</p>
<p>Based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller, this is the fictionalized retelling of the Battle Termopylae - part of the Persian Wars. Directed by Zack Snyder, the movie was filmed with a super-imposition chroma key technique to help replicate the imagery of the original comic book. Editing on the movie was by William Hoy.</p>
<p>To capture the graphic novel look and feel of the film’s images, editor Hoy used a number of the key Final Cut Pro features such as the adjustment layer and blending modes to create depth and mood. With the look and feel of this movie so dependent on the effects created, editor Hoy spent a lot of time debating what was being added visually to each shot and how this would impact the length and continuity of each scene.</p>

                ></p>
<p>9. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004)</p>
<p>With big name stars (Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law), this was an unusual film that used digital artists to build multi-layered 2D and 3D backgrounds for live action footage, with hand-drawn storyboards recreated as computer-generated 3D animatics. Critically it was well received but didn’t set the box office alight.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Sabrina Plisco.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro was particularly critical to create a scene between two characters that was shot in a physical set (unlike the digital soundstage that was used for the rest of the movie). Final Cut Pro allowed the filmmakers to line up the animatics with the live onstage footage. One of the challenges with this movie is that the editors had to manually assign time-codes to each take - the clips were then rendered out and sorted so that they could be used on a Final Cut Pro SD workstation. This approach was also used to create the master off-line cut. Batch lists of the cuts were then imported into Final Cut Pro.</p>

                ></p>
<p>10. Cold Mountain (2003)</p>
<p>This is an epic Civil War drama based on the novel by Charles Frazier. Starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renee Zellweger this was critically acclaimed and performed reasonably well at the box office.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing let by editor Walter Murch.</p>
<p>This was really seen as the breakthrough movie for the use of Final Cut Pro in Hollywood Movies. An entire book has been produced analysing how editor Murch used Final Cut Pro to edit the movie and analysis its impact on future cinema productions. Editor Murch believes that the use of Final Cut Pro on this movie indirected affected the ultimate creative outcome. In particular, the use of the DVD authoring capabilities on Final Cut Pro meant that the editing team was able to look at the material more often, sharing it with more people, and changing the way that they looked at certain scenes.</p>
<hr>
<p>While Hollywood movies require editing tools of the highest order, the range of effects that you can achieve using Final Cut Pro is impressive - as well as the standard ripple, roll, slip, slide, scrub, razor blade and time remapping edit functions, Final Cut Pro also comes with a range of video transitions and a range of video and audio filters that will take your film project to the next level.</p>
<p>It is clear that Final Cut Pro is definitely now a star in the editing of Hollywood movies, it is time to make it a star in editing your movies as well.</p>

<p>2. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)</p>
<p>This was the US adaptation of the earlier Swedish film of the same name - based on the novel by Stieg Larsson. Starring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, the story is a crime thriller trying to uncover the secrets surrounding the disappearance of a young girl from a wealthy family.</p>
<p>One of the challenges with this movie was that there were a lot of invisible effects throughout the film. Final Cut Pro was used to achieve the shot stabilization and the visual enhancements - everything from matte painting to creating seasonal elements such as snow.</p>

<p>3. John Carter (2011)</p>
<p>A science fiction adventure, this film performed so badly at the box office that it caused major financial problems for its studio Disney.</p>
<p>The editing of the John Carter movie was a particular challenge as a lot of the action was shot twice during the troubled production. The editor Eric Zumbrunnen used Final Cut Pro to piece the various elements together. With a huge range of CGI and creature effects to deal with, the editing process on this movie was extremely complex. Final Cut Pro was used to create a lot of the background detail need to bring the green screen scenes to life.</p>

<p>4. 500 Days of Summer (2009)</p>
<p>This was a cute, quirky romantic comedy starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Alan Edward Bell in DVCPro HD format on Final Cut Pro. Because the storyline of the movie unfolds in a non-linear timeline, the workflow feature of Final Cut Pro made it easier to manage the sequencing of the different scenes. There were also 250 invisible effects which were created using Final Cut Pro’s editing features.</p>

<p>5. X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)</p>
<p>Continuing the X-Men franchise, this installment traces Wolverine’s childhood and the relationship with his brother. It didn’t really appeal to X-Men fans or movie critics.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Nicolas De Toth and Megan Gill. There were a number of continuity glitches identified during the production of this movie but De Toth and Gill used Final Pro Cut to keep a consistent flow to the narrative. What is interesting about the editing on this movie is that all the cutting of the scenes required was done on Final Cut Pro 5, taking advantage of the software’s HD abilities and also the multi-clip features.</p>

<p>6. Burn After Reading (2008)</p>
<p>A black comedy from the talented brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, they wrote, produced, edited, and directed the movie.</p>
<p>The Coen brothers used Final Cut Pro on this movie because it was simple and easy to use - they were blocking together the rough cuts as the scenes were being shot, and Final Cut Pro gave them the flexibility that they needed to edit quickly. On this movie most of the action was shot using Sony cameras but there were several scenes on which a RED camera was added when an additional camera was needed. Even though there is a significantly different workflow between the two types of camera, the RED material was able to be integrated smoothly with the Sony footage.</p>

<p>A neo-Western thriller from Coen brothers. They directed, wrote, and edited this production.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing for editor Roderick Jaynes (a pseudonym for Joel and Ethan Coen).</p>
<p>Directing and editing a movie brings the two processes a lot closer together for the Coen brothers. An easy to use product such as Final Cut Pro ensures that they can construct the movie’s narrative using the timeline features of the product. This movie marked a chance in approach for the Coen brothers, who took advantage of the better resolution DVCPRO HD for their cutting process compared to earlier films that were cut at DV resolution.</p>

<p>9. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004)</p>
<p>With big name stars (Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law), this was an unusual film that used digital artists to build multi-layered 2D and 3D backgrounds for live action footage, with hand-drawn storyboards recreated as computer-generated 3D animatics. Critically it was well received but didn’t set the box office alight.</p>

<p>While Hollywood movies require editing tools of the highest order, the range of effects that you can achieve using Final Cut Pro is impressive - as well as the standard ripple, roll, slip, slide, scrub, razor blade and time remapping edit functions, Final Cut Pro also comes with a range of video transitions and a range of video and audio filters that will take your film project to the next level.</p>
<p>It is clear that Final Cut Pro is definitely now a star in the editing of Hollywood movies, it is time to make it a star in editing your movies as well.</p>

However, in recent years the capabilities of Final Cut Pro have evolved significantly and we are now seeing major Hollywood movies also being edited with this software.</p>

<p>1. The Social Network (2010)</p>
<p>Based on the rise of the phenomenon that we now know as Facebook, The Social Network starred Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake. The movie performed well at the box office and was also positively received by movie critics.</p>
<p>The film won an Academy Award for Best Editing, collected by Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall. They used Final Cut Pro to edit the film, and one of the things they really like about the software is the ability to do multiple timelines. Final Cut Pro was also used in this movie to enable face replacement in a number of scenes. Two of the key characters in the movie are twins, and so the scenes were filmed with actors (who weren’t twins) and then the editing software was used to create the illusion that they were twins. Digital matte paintings was another feature of this movie that relied on the functionality of Final Cut Pro.</p>

<p>One of the challenges with this movie was that there were a lot of invisible effects throughout the film. Final Cut Pro was used to achieve the shot stabilization and the visual enhancements - everything from matte painting to creating seasonal elements such as snow.</p>

                ></p>
<p>1. The Social Network (2010)</p>
<p>Based on the rise of the phenomenon that we now know as Facebook, The Social Network starred Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake. The movie performed well at the box office and was also positively received by movie critics.</p>
<p>The film won an Academy Award for Best Editing, collected by Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall. They used Final Cut Pro to edit the film, and one of the things they really like about the software is the ability to do multiple timelines. Final Cut Pro was also used in this movie to enable face replacement in a number of scenes. Two of the key characters in the movie are twins, and so the scenes were filmed with actors (who weren’t twins) and then the editing software was used to create the illusion that they were twins. Digital matte paintings was another feature of this movie that relied on the functionality of Final Cut Pro.</p>

                      alt="Movie made by FCP - The girl with dragon tattoo"
                ></p>
<p>2. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)</p>
<p>This was the US adaptation of the earlier Swedish film of the same name - based on the novel by Stieg Larsson. Starring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, the story is a crime thriller trying to uncover the secrets surrounding the disappearance of a young girl from a wealthy family.</p>
<p>One of the challenges with this movie was that there were a lot of invisible effects throughout the film. Final Cut Pro was used to achieve the shot stabilization and the visual enhancements - everything from matte painting to creating seasonal elements such as snow.</p>

                ></p>
<p>3. John Carter (2011)</p>
<p>A science fiction adventure, this film performed so badly at the box office that it caused major financial problems for its studio Disney.</p>
<p>The editing of the John Carter movie was a particular challenge as a lot of the action was shot twice during the troubled production. The editor Eric Zumbrunnen used Final Cut Pro to piece the various elements together. With a huge range of CGI and creature effects to deal with, the editing process on this movie was extremely complex. Final Cut Pro was used to create a lot of the background detail need to bring the green screen scenes to life.</p>

                ></p>
<p>4. 500 Days of Summer (2009)</p>
<p>This was a cute, quirky romantic comedy starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Alan Edward Bell in DVCPro HD format on Final Cut Pro. Because the storyline of the movie unfolds in a non-linear timeline, the workflow feature of Final Cut Pro made it easier to manage the sequencing of the different scenes. There were also 250 invisible effects which were created using Final Cut Pro’s editing features.</p>

                ></p>
<p>5. X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)</p>
<p>Continuing the X-Men franchise, this installment traces Wolverine’s childhood and the relationship with his brother. It didn’t really appeal to X-Men fans or movie critics.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Nicolas De Toth and Megan Gill. There were a number of continuity glitches identified during the production of this movie but De Toth and Gill used Final Pro Cut to keep a consistent flow to the narrative. What is interesting about the editing on this movie is that all the cutting of the scenes required was done on Final Cut Pro 5, taking advantage of the software’s HD abilities and also the multi-clip features.</p>

                ></p>
<p>6. Burn After Reading (2008)</p>
<p>A black comedy from the talented brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, they wrote, produced, edited, and directed the movie.</p>
<p>The Coen brothers used Final Cut Pro on this movie because it was simple and easy to use - they were blocking together the rough cuts as the scenes were being shot, and Final Cut Pro gave them the flexibility that they needed to edit quickly. On this movie most of the action was shot using Sony cameras but there were several scenes on which a RED camera was added when an additional camera was needed. Even though there is a significantly different workflow between the two types of camera, the RED material was able to be integrated smoothly with the Sony footage.</p>

                      alt="Movie made by FCP - No country for old man"
                ></p>
<p>7. No Country for Old Men (2007)</p>
<p>A neo-Western thriller from Coen brothers. They directed, wrote, and edited this production.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing for editor Roderick Jaynes (a pseudonym for Joel and Ethan Coen).</p>
<p>Directing and editing a movie brings the two processes a lot closer together for the Coen brothers. An easy to use product such as Final Cut Pro ensures that they can construct the movie’s narrative using the timeline features of the product. This movie marked a chance in approach for the Coen brothers, who took advantage of the better resolution DVCPRO HD for their cutting process compared to earlier films that were cut at DV resolution.</p>

                ></p>
<p>8. 300 (2007)</p>
<p>Based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller, this is the fictionalized retelling of the Battle Termopylae - part of the Persian Wars. Directed by Zack Snyder, the movie was filmed with a super-imposition chroma key technique to help replicate the imagery of the original comic book. Editing on the movie was by William Hoy.</p>
<p>To capture the graphic novel look and feel of the film’s images, editor Hoy used a number of the key Final Cut Pro features such as the adjustment layer and blending modes to create depth and mood. With the look and feel of this movie so dependent on the effects created, editor Hoy spent a lot of time debating what was being added visually to each shot and how this would impact the length and continuity of each scene.</p>

                ></p>
<p>9. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004)</p>
<p>With big name stars (Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law), this was an unusual film that used digital artists to build multi-layered 2D and 3D backgrounds for live action footage, with hand-drawn storyboards recreated as computer-generated 3D animatics. Critically it was well received but didn’t set the box office alight.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Sabrina Plisco.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro was particularly critical to create a scene between two characters that was shot in a physical set (unlike the digital soundstage that was used for the rest of the movie). Final Cut Pro allowed the filmmakers to line up the animatics with the live onstage footage. One of the challenges with this movie is that the editors had to manually assign time-codes to each take - the clips were then rendered out and sorted so that they could be used on a Final Cut Pro SD workstation. This approach was also used to create the master off-line cut. Batch lists of the cuts were then imported into Final Cut Pro.</p>

                ></p>
<p>10. Cold Mountain (2003)</p>
<p>This is an epic Civil War drama based on the novel by Charles Frazier. Starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renee Zellweger this was critically acclaimed and performed reasonably well at the box office.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing let by editor Walter Murch.</p>
<p>This was really seen as the breakthrough movie for the use of Final Cut Pro in Hollywood Movies. An entire book has been produced analysing how editor Murch used Final Cut Pro to edit the movie and analysis its impact on future cinema productions. Editor Murch believes that the use of Final Cut Pro on this movie indirected affected the ultimate creative outcome. In particular, the use of the DVD authoring capabilities on Final Cut Pro meant that the editing team was able to look at the material more often, sharing it with more people, and changing the way that they looked at certain scenes.</p>
<hr>
<p>While Hollywood movies require editing tools of the highest order, the range of effects that you can achieve using Final Cut Pro is impressive - as well as the standard ripple, roll, slip, slide, scrub, razor blade and time remapping edit functions, Final Cut Pro also comes with a range of video transitions and a range of video and audio filters that will take your film project to the next level.</p>
<p>It is clear that Final Cut Pro is definitely now a star in the editing of Hollywood movies, it is time to make it a star in editing your movies as well.</p>
