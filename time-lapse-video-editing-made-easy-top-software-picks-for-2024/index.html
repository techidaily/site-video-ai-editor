<p>All types of vistas change as time passes. Consequently, an outdoor scene looks differently throughout different parts of the day, which makes it impossible to capture the full extent of its beauty by snapping a single photo or recording a short video of it.</p>
<p>That is why you must utilize the <strong>time-lapse technique</strong> to depict the passage of time at a particular shooting location and create a sequence in your video that suggests that a certain amount of time has passed by. So in this article, we will take you through some of the <strong>best time-lapse video editing software</strong> you can find on the market in 2024.</p>

You can either <strong>record videos or take photos at a precisely set interval</strong>, but regardless of the approach you choose, you must have the right equipment for the job.</p>
<p>This means that you must have a time-lapse tripod that ensures the smooth movement of your camera, an intervalometer, and a camera setup capable of taking pictures or recording videos over an extended period of time.</p>
<p>Most importantly, you must have access to a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that enables you to process the footage and control its playback rate.

<p>Mac and PC users can create time-lapse videos with Filmora effortlessly, even though the actual steps you will need to take throughout the process depend on the type of footage you’re using to create a time-lapse. If you decide to make a time-lapse out of still images, you must ensure that you have enough footage since the video you’re producing must have 24 or 30 frames per second. That’s why you need <strong>30 or 24 photos</strong> for each second of your time-lapse video, and you must arrange all of these images on the editor’s timeline before you begin adjusting their duration.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Select all timeline photos placed in the timeline panel, right-click to access the   <strong>Duration setting</strong>, and then <strong>set the input duration of each picture to 0.01 seconds</strong>.</p>
<p>Click OK to continue, and you’ll find that the duration of all timelapse photos has changed to a brief second. Click the playback button in the Preview window, and you’ll see the time-lapse video is made already.</p>

<p>If you are working with video files, you should <strong>double the playback rate</strong> to create the time-lapse effect.

<p>That is why you must utilize the <strong>time-lapse technique</strong> to depict the passage of time at a particular shooting location and create a sequence in your video that suggests that a certain amount of time has passed by. So in this article, we will take you through some of the <strong>best time-lapse video editing software</strong> you can find on the market in 2024.</p>

<p>Mac and PC users can create time-lapse videos with Filmora effortlessly, even though the actual steps you will need to take throughout the process depend on the type of footage you’re using to create a time-lapse. If you decide to make a time-lapse out of still images, you must ensure that you have enough footage since the video you’re producing must have 24 or 30 frames per second. That’s why you need <strong>30 or 24 photos</strong> for each second of your time-lapse video, and you must arrange all of these images on the editor’s timeline before you begin adjusting their duration.</p>

<p>Select all timeline photos placed in the timeline panel, right-click to access the   <strong>Duration setting</strong>, and then <strong>set the input duration of each picture to 0.01 seconds</strong>.</p>
<p>Click OK to continue, and you’ll find that the duration of all timelapse photos has changed to a brief second. Click the playback button in the Preview window, and you’ll see the time-lapse video is made already.</p>

<p>All types of vistas change as time passes. Consequently, an outdoor scene looks differently throughout different parts of the day, which makes it impossible to capture the full extent of its beauty by snapping a single photo or recording a short video of it.</p>
<p>That is why you must utilize the <strong>time-lapse technique</strong> to depict the passage of time at a particular shooting location and create a sequence in your video that suggests that a certain amount of time has passed by. So in this article, we will take you through some of the <strong>best time-lapse video editing software</strong> you can find on the market in 2024.</p>

<p>Mac and PC users can create time-lapse videos with Filmora effortlessly, even though the actual steps you will need to take throughout the process depend on the type of footage you’re using to create a time-lapse. If you decide to make a time-lapse out of still images, you must ensure that you have enough footage since the video you’re producing must have 24 or 30 frames per second. That’s why you need <strong>30 or 24 photos</strong> for each second of your time-lapse video, and you must arrange all of these images on the editor’s timeline before you begin adjusting their duration.</p>

<p>Select all timeline photos placed in the timeline panel, right-click to access the   <strong>Duration setting</strong>, and then <strong>set the input duration of each picture to 0.01 seconds</strong>.</p>
<p>Click OK to continue, and you’ll find that the duration of all timelapse photos has changed to a brief second. Click the playback button in the Preview window, and you’ll see the time-lapse video is made already.</p>

<p>If you are working with video files, you should <strong>double the playback rate</strong> to create the time-lapse effect. The results you will get largely depend on the quality of the footage you’ve recorded. You must do everything in your power to capture the photos or videos properly before you start the video editing process.</p>
<p>You can check the details about two ways of <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >making a time-lapse video in Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> here.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  macOS and iOS</p>
<p>iMovie may not be the most advanced video editing software for Mac computers, but that doesn’t mean that you can’t use iMovie to create time-lapse videos. In fact, all you have to do to make a time-lapse video with this software is to arrange the photos on the editor’s timeline and change their duration to <strong>0.1</strong> seconds from the <strong>Clip Information panel</strong>.</p>
<p>However, if you do this, your time-lapse video will play only <strong>10 frames per second</strong>, so to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >speed it up <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you first have to export the video you’ve created in this manner and then import it back into iMovie.</p>
<p>Afterward, you can select the <strong>Custom option</strong> from the <strong>Speed menu</strong> that lets you select the playback speed of a video clip. Making a time-lapse video in iMovie is a slow process that requires a lot of patience, especially if you are working with a large number of photos or video clips.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Windows</p>
<p>This open-source video editor is commonly used for batch-processing of <strong>AVI video files</strong> and sets of <strong>BMP image files</strong>. Even though VirtualDub doesn’t offer a lot of video editing tools, its batch-processing capabilities make it a perfect choice for all PC users who want to create time-lapse videos.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the process of making a time-lapse in VirtualDub is highly technical as you’ll need to make sure that all the images you want to use in the video are the <strong>same size</strong>. Besides, you’ll have to set up the <strong>video’s <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >frame rate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >aspect ratio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and compression manually</strong>, before you can apply it to all files you imported into the video editor. That’s why you first need to familiarize yourself with VirtualDub and then start using it to make time-lapse videos.</p>

<p>GoPro cameras offer a plethora of ways to capture the footage you can later turn into time-lapse videos. Besides a GoPro camera, you will also need additional equipment like <strong>rotating camera mounts, extra batteries, or several memory cards</strong> to record the time-lapse footage properly.</p>
<p>GoPro’s Quik video editor features all the tools you’re going to need to organize large quantities of video and photo files and create time-lapse videos. The software also enables you to add <strong>panning effects</strong> to your time-lapses that simulate the camera movement. However, GoPro Quik is a good choice only for filmmakers and video content creators who record most of their footage with different models of GoPro cameras.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  macOS</p>
<p>Controlling the playback speed of the files you import into a project in FCPX is simple, since you just have to place the photos or videos on the timeline and select them. Afterward, you should head over to the <strong>Retime</strong> submenu that is located in the <strong>Modify drop-down menu</strong> and select one of the <strong>Custom Speed, Blade Speed or Fast</strong> options.</p>
<p>You will have to tweak the particular settings depending on the option you select, but your main goal should be to speed up the footage just enough to suggest the rapid passage of time. Try out different values to find the playback speed that is best suited for the time-lapse video you’re working on.</p>

<p>The way you capture your photos and organize them is crucial in creating a time-lapse video in Adobe Premiere Pro. You must <strong>arrange all the photos numerically</strong>, and once you’re ready to import them into the software, you must make sure that the <strong>Image Sequence checkbox</strong> is selected. Adobe Premiere Pro will automatically generate a video from the photos so you can add a video file to the timeline instead of hundreds of still images. This professional video editing software provides with a broad range of video editing tools you can use to <strong>simulate camera movement, perform color correction or control the video’s playback speed</strong>.

<p>If you are working with video files, you should <strong>double the playback rate</strong> to create the time-lapse effect. The results you will get largely depend on the quality of the footage you’ve recorded. You must do everything in your power to capture the photos or videos properly before you start the video editing process.</p>

<p>iMovie may not be the most advanced video editing software for Mac computers, but that doesn’t mean that you can’t use iMovie to create time-lapse videos. In fact, all you have to do to make a time-lapse video with this software is to arrange the photos on the editor’s timeline and change their duration to <strong>0.1</strong> seconds from the <strong>Clip Information panel</strong>.</p>
<p>However, if you do this, your time-lapse video will play only <strong>10 frames per second</strong>, so to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >speed it up <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you first have to export the video you’ve created in this manner and then import it back into iMovie.</p>
<p>Afterward, you can select the <strong>Custom option</strong> from the <strong>Speed menu</strong> that lets you select the playback speed of a video clip. Making a time-lapse video in iMovie is a slow process that requires a lot of patience, especially if you are working with a large number of photos or video clips.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Windows</p>
<p>This open-source video editor is commonly used for batch-processing of <strong>AVI video files</strong> and sets of <strong>BMP image files</strong>. Even though VirtualDub doesn’t offer a lot of video editing tools, its batch-processing capabilities make it a perfect choice for all PC users who want to create time-lapse videos.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the process of making a time-lapse in VirtualDub is highly technical as you’ll need to make sure that all the images you want to use in the video are the <strong>same size</strong>. Besides, you’ll have to set up the <strong>video’s <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >frame rate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >aspect ratio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and compression manually</strong>, before you can apply it to all files you imported into the video editor. That’s why you first need to familiarize yourself with VirtualDub and then start using it to make time-lapse videos.</p>

<p>GoPro cameras offer a plethora of ways to capture the footage you can later turn into time-lapse videos. Besides a GoPro camera, you will also need additional equipment like <strong>rotating camera mounts, extra batteries, or several memory cards</strong> to record the time-lapse footage properly.</p>
<p>GoPro’s Quik video editor features all the tools you’re going to need to organize large quantities of video and photo files and create time-lapse videos. The software also enables you to add <strong>panning effects</strong> to your time-lapses that simulate the camera movement.

<p>Controlling the playback speed of the files you import into a project in FCPX is simple, since you just have to place the photos or videos on the timeline and select them. Afterward, you should head over to the <strong>Retime</strong> submenu that is located in the <strong>Modify drop-down menu</strong> and select one of the <strong>Custom Speed, Blade Speed or Fast</strong> options.</p>
<p>You will have to tweak the particular settings depending on the option you select, but your main goal should be to speed up the footage just enough to suggest the rapid passage of time.

<p>Did you know your Mac device comes with a built-in speech-to-text feature? So whether you use a laptop or desktop, you can generate text from your voice through your device’s microphone. Officially known as Dictation, the app allows you to transcribe text anywhere you can type it. So, for example, you can use Apple Dictation for your messaging and word processing apps.</p>
<p>The feature has been available since macOS Sierra as a free built-in feature. Earlier versions of Apple Dictation relied on its voice recognition software. However, it now relies on Siri for users of macOS Catalina onwards.</p>
<p>Typically, the app allows you to transcribe thirty seconds and below of audio. However, you can enable Enhanced dictation for longer transcription times. According to most users, the app is suitable for getting the first draft of your assignment, which you can manually edit later.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to enable Apple Dictation on your Mac:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tap the Apple logo on the top-left toolbar of your screen and select <strong>System Preferences</strong> from the resulting menu.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Keyboard</strong> option from the system preferences screen.</li>
<li>Once there, click on the <strong>Dictation</strong> option located at the top of the menu.</li>
<li>Select <strong>On</strong> to activate the app in its default mode. In addition, you can check the <strong>Use Enhanced Dictation</strong> box to enable additional functions such as offline use and text commands like bold and italics.</li>
<li>Finally, select your language from the dropdown menu and choose a shortcut key.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that you need to speak your punctuation loudly when using Apple Dictation. Otherwise, the app will consider them as regular words.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Another option to consider is speech-to-text Microsoft Word Mac. The app is free to use and relies on Microsoft Azure Speech Services to transcribe text. Below are the requirements to use speech-to-text word mac.</p>
<ul>
<li>An external microphone for your Mac desktop, or you can use your built-in microphone for your MacBook. This is because speech-to-text on Microsoft word mac only allows input with a microphone rather than an audio file upload.</li>
<li>An active Office 365 subscription. Please note you need to log in to your account for the app to function.</li>
<li>Insider builds 16.32 (19120802) and above.</li>
<li>An active internet connection.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have everything set up, follow these steps to use speech-to-text on Word.</p>
<ol>
<li>Launch Microsoft Word from your desktop.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Dictate</strong> button from the top menu of your Word document, and wait for the red dot to appear. The button features a microphone for easy identification.</li>
<li>Once the dot appears, start speaking to transcribe your text. Ensure you are in a quiet environment for the best results. In addition, speak louder when transcribing punctuations.</li>
<li>Click on the Dictate button to finish the transcription.</li>

<p>Dragon Dictate is arguably the best dictation software currently on the market. According to most users, its accuracy and feature sets are next to none. For example, the Smart Format Rules learn how you represent dates, numbers, and abbreviations, resulting in less editing work for you. The Dragon Dictate app is free to download from the Apple Store.</p>
<p>Dragon for Mac users reports a dictation accuracy of nearly 99%, which is excellent in the speech-to-text software category. All of Nuance’s Dragon products use deep learning technology to capture your accent and cadence. As such, the app gets better at transcribing your text as you continue using it. In addition, dragon for Mac professional allows you to transcribe audio clips from uploaded files. For example, you can import audio from your iPhone to your Dragon Dictate workspace and transcribe it hassle-free.</p>
