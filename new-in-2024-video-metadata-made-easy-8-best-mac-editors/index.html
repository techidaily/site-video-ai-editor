<p>Metadata is the pieces of information that help viewers understand what a video is about without having to watch it from start to finish. Things like titles, keywords, tags, timestamps, and descriptions are some metadata that should be added to a video before it is published online.</p>
<p>Adding the right metadata to your video is useful for many reasons. It makes it easy for search engines to correctly identify and index your video. This in turn helps viewers find your video when they search Google, iTunes, or video sharing platforms like YouTube and Vimeo.</p>
<p>For more experienced videographers, metadata is useful at every stage of the process of making a video, from production to post-production and publishing. Without the right metadata, professional video production and editing would be a very uphill task.</p>
<p>The best multimedia editors have metadata editing features. It’s also good to have a lightweight, standalone application to edit and customize video metadata quickly. In this post, we share the 8 best video metadata editors for macOS users.</p>

FilmoraPro lets users add metadata during the export process. Simply click the export button, which is now at the top of the media window. In the pop-up screen, click on the YouTube, Vimeo, or DVD tab, depending on how you want to publish your video, and edit the title, description, tags, category and privacy settings accordingly.</p>

<p>Metadata is the pieces of information that help viewers understand what a video is about without having to watch it from start to finish. Things like titles, keywords, tags, timestamps, and descriptions are some metadata that should be added to a video before it is published online.</p>
<p>Adding the right metadata to your video is useful for many reasons. It makes it easy for search engines to correctly identify and index your video. This in turn helps viewers find your video when they search Google, iTunes, or video sharing platforms like YouTube and Vimeo.</p>
<p>For more experienced videographers, metadata is useful at every stage of the process of making a video, from production to post-production and publishing. Without the right metadata, professional video production and editing would be a very uphill task.</p>
<p>The best multimedia editors have metadata editing features. It’s also good to have a lightweight, standalone application to edit and customize video metadata quickly. In this post, we share the 8 best video metadata editors for macOS users.</p>

Getting a live voice actor to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> for you is very expensive — since you’re paying not only for the voice-actors hours spent but also the use of the expensive equipment that they use for creating voiceovers.</p>
<p>In that regard, even PAID text-to-speech converters are easier on the budget. Making it the perfect solution for content creators who want to increase the accessibility of their content but do not have the time (to create the voiceovers themselves) or the money (to hire someone else to record it).</p>

And, depending on what you’re looking for, you might find yourself longing for extra features later on down the line. That is why, when looking to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> we recommend considering the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Converting Time</strong>: How fast does the converter work? Most text-to-speech converters work almost instantaneously! So, if the one you’re using currently is slow? It might be best to give it a pass over to the next candidate.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Sound Quality</strong>: You should also test out whether or not the sound quality of the converted text to speech is good.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Multi-Language Support</strong>: Since this is all for the sake of increasing accessibility, you should start thinking about how many languages your converter supports as well. You might not be able to use all of them or even want to. But, that extra function can be helpful for the future.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Voice-Control Options</strong>: Does the converter offers you advanced voice controls? Your average converter usually offers speed and voice options, but you might find that a text-to-speech converter with more advanced options (i.e., tone, pitch, etc. controls) may help you get better quality content in the long run.</p>

Specifically, a FREEmium text-to-speech converter that you can use when you’re still on the trying-out stage! This part will include a tutorial and a short introduction:</p>
<h3 id="014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited"><a href="#014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited" class="headerlink" title="014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?"></a>014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?</h3><p>First, for the promised tutorial! Most <strong>text-to-human voice converter</strong>s function much the same way. The main difference usually being on the number of features focused and the limitations imposed (for tools with FREEmium services that impose limits on the FREE version, like the tool we’ll be using for our example):</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Upload Text</strong></p>
<p>First, upload the text that you want to convert into speech!</p>
<p>Most online converters offer a text box that you can use in order to copy &amp; paste the text onto (like in the image below), while others offer an ‘upload’ feature that you can use to upload text from a document.</p>

                      alt="Upload or Copy &amp; Paste Text"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Adjust Voice Reader!</strong></p>
<p>Next, the main thing that you usually have to worry about is the voice options.</p>
<p>Most TTS converters at least offer the opportunity to choose what voice you want the text to be read in. Some, more advanced solutions, may offer voices in other languages, dialects, accents, etc. as well as voice control options (tone, pitch, etc.)</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Set Voice Reader"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Reader Controls!</strong></p>
<p>Outside of voice options, most text-to-speech converters also offer the ability to control the general outcome of the converted text to speech.</p>
<p>More advanced tools will have multiple options on offer for this, but even the most basic ones at least offer a method for controlling the speed at which the text is read by the voice you’ve chosen!</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Convert Text to MP3!</strong></p>
<p>Now is finally the time to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> format! Some TTS readers will not allow for this without you paying the premium price, but most will at least offer a limited MP3 conversion feature (usually one that limits the length of conversion or the quality).</p>

In this next part, we’ll be focusing on “super tips”</p>
<p>OR, tips that allow you to generally make the most of these <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> to the fullest!</p>
<p><strong>Tip 1: Use AI Text-to-Speech!</strong></p>
<p>Our first tip is to encourage you to take full advantage of AI text-to-speech functions. Artificial Intelligence allows the converted text to sound much nicer and much more like it was read by an actual human being — which enables you to create a very professional-sounding project without having to hire a voiceover actor&#x2F;actress.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-9.png"
                      alt="Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Text-to-Speech"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 2: Language and Regions Settings!</strong></p>
<p>If your content is available in multiple languages and you want to convert all of the different editions of said content, you’ll need to find a converter that supports all of those languages. You may also consider looking for regional support as well. For example, for basic English language, most TTS converters usually have “American” voices as well as “British” voices to support different accents despite them using the same text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-10.png"
                      alt="Language and Regions Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 3: Pick an Appropriate Voice!</strong></p>
<p>The voice you choose to read your text is also very important. Some premium <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> offer a great variety to choose from to give you options when it comes to what kind of voice you want to read your content.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="TTS Voices Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Audio Settings!</strong></p>
<p>This is a bit of a rare feature, but some TTS converters will allow you to adjust your audio before it converts your <strong>content from text to speech (MP3)</strong>. Sometimes, this is as simple as allowing you to choose an audio format (as is shown in the image below), other times, it allows you to control the actual sound quality of the finished product.</p>

                     lazyload

                      alt="TTS Audio Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 5: Adjust Voice Speed!</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, we emphasized the importance of choosing your voice reader carefully! Now, we focus on the subject of speed. Some voices are better when they are slowed down, others are better when sped up. Play around with these settings to see which way is more natural for your chosen voice!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="TTS Voice Speed Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 6: Adjust Voice Pitch</strong></p>
<p>To allow for even more flexibility when it comes to voice style, you’ll find that some TTS converters will allow you to adjust voice pitch! This is a helpful feature for when you’re looking for that particular voice type, as it will allow you to experiment more with the kind of sound you want your content to be known for.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Voice Pitch Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 7: Voice Effects Options!</strong></p>
<p>Another advanced feature that you might run into (and should definitely take advantage of), is voice effects! This, again, will allow you to fully customize the type of voice that your content is known for. It’s also great for when you’re aiming for a more natural sound (if you’re patient enough in order to take full advantage of it!)</p>

                      alt="Voice Effects Options"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 8: Use Advanced Video Editing!</strong></p>
<p>Our last tip is not on the subject of using a TTS converter itself, but on the tool, you use in order to create your final project! For that, we recommend <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>.</p>

Text-to-Speech, also called TTS, as previously mentioned, is an accessibility invention. It was developed to help those with vision impairment or blindness — giving them the ability to have text read to them out loud to them (without requiring someone specifically read it out loud for them.</p>
<p>More recent development in TTS technology has allowed it to grow more useful outside of those parameters, however. Especially seeing as it is now possible to convert <strong>text to MP3 with natural voices</strong>.</p>

And, depending on what you’re looking for, you might find yourself longing for extra features later on down the line. That is why, when looking to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> we recommend considering the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Converting Time</strong>: How fast does the converter work? Most text-to-speech converters work almost instantaneously! So, if the one you’re using currently is slow? It might be best to give it a pass over to the next candidate.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Sound Quality</strong>: You should also test out whether or not the sound quality of the converted text to speech is good.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Multi-Language Support</strong>: Since this is all for the sake of increasing accessibility, you should start thinking about how many languages your converter supports as well. You might not be able to use all of them or even want to. But, that extra function can be helpful for the future.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Voice-Control Options</strong>: Does the converter offers you advanced voice controls? Your average converter usually offers speed and voice options, but you might find that a text-to-speech converter with more advanced options (i.e., tone, pitch, etc. controls) may help you get better quality content in the long run.</p>

Specifically, a FREEmium text-to-speech converter that you can use when you’re still on the trying-out stage! This part will include a tutorial and a short introduction:</p>
<h3 id="014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited-1"><a href="#014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited-1" class="headerlink" title="014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?"></a>014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?</h3><p>First, for the promised tutorial! Most <strong>text-to-human voice converter</strong>s function much the same way. The main difference usually being on the number of features focused and the limitations imposed (for tools with FREEmium services that impose limits on the FREE version, like the tool we’ll be using for our example):</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Upload Text</strong></p>
<p>First, upload the text that you want to convert into speech!</p>
<p>Most online converters offer a text box that you can use in order to copy &amp; paste the text onto (like in the image below), while others offer an ‘upload’ feature that you can use to upload text from a document.</p>

                      alt="Upload or Copy &amp; Paste Text"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Adjust Voice Reader!</strong></p>
<p>Next, the main thing that you usually have to worry about is the voice options.</p>
<p>Most TTS converters at least offer the opportunity to choose what voice you want the text to be read in. Some, more advanced solutions, may offer voices in other languages, dialects, accents, etc. as well as voice control options (tone, pitch, etc.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Set Voice Reader"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Reader Controls!</strong></p>
<p>Outside of voice options, most text-to-speech converters also offer the ability to control the general outcome of the converted text to speech.</p>
<p>More advanced tools will have multiple options on offer for this, but even the most basic ones at least offer a method for controlling the speed at which the text is read by the voice you’ve chosen!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Adjust Speech Controls"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Convert Text to MP3!</strong></p>
<p>Now is finally the time to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> format! Some TTS readers will not allow for this without you paying the premium price, but most will at least offer a limited MP3 conversion feature (usually one that limits the length of conversion or the quality).</p>

It’s the online <strong>text to human voice converter</strong>, NaturalReader (URL has been provided below!) You can use this tool either directly or on your desktop (a software version is available.) It is FREEmium software though. That means that, if you want to make use of all of its advanced features, you’ll need to pay a price!</p>

In this next part, we’ll be focusing on “super tips”</p>
<p>OR, tips that allow you to generally make the most of these <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> to the fullest!</p>
<p><strong>Tip 1: Use AI Text-to-Speech!</strong></p>
<p>Our first tip is to encourage you to take full advantage of AI text-to-speech functions. Artificial Intelligence allows the converted text to sound much nicer and much more like it was read by an actual human being — which enables you to create a very professional-sounding project without having to hire a voiceover actor&#x2F;actress.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-9.png"
                      alt="Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Text-to-Speech"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 2: Language and Regions Settings!</strong></p>
<p>If your content is available in multiple languages and you want to convert all of the different editions of said content, you’ll need to find a converter that supports all of those languages. You may also consider looking for regional support as well. For example, for basic English language, most TTS converters usually have “American” voices as well as “British” voices to support different accents despite them using the same text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-10.png"
                      alt="Language and Regions Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 3: Pick an Appropriate Voice!</strong></p>
<p>The voice you choose to read your text is also very important. Some premium <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> offer a great variety to choose from to give you options when it comes to what kind of voice you want to read your content.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-11.png"
                      alt="TTS Voices Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Audio Settings!</strong></p>
<p>This is a bit of a rare feature, but some TTS converters will allow you to adjust your audio before it converts your <strong>content from text to speech (MP3)</strong>. Sometimes, this is as simple as allowing you to choose an audio format (as is shown in the image below), other times, it allows you to control the actual sound quality of the finished product.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="TTS Audio Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 5: Adjust Voice Speed!</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, we emphasized the importance of choosing your voice reader carefully! Now, we focus on the subject of speed. Some voices are better when they are slowed down, others are better when sped up. Play around with these settings to see which way is more natural for your chosen voice!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-13.png"
                      alt="TTS Voice Speed Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 6: Adjust Voice Pitch</strong></p>
<p>To allow for even more flexibility when it comes to voice style, you’ll find that some TTS converters will allow you to adjust voice pitch! This is a helpful feature for when you’re looking for that particular voice type, as it will allow you to experiment more with the kind of sound you want your content to be known for.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Voice Pitch Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 7: Voice Effects Options!</strong></p>
<p>Another advanced feature that you might run into (and should definitely take advantage of), is voice effects! This, again, will allow you to fully customize the type of voice that your content is known for. It’s also great for when you’re aiming for a more natural sound (if you’re patient enough in order to take full advantage of it!)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Voice Effects Options"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 8: Use Advanced Video Editing!</strong></p>
<p>Our last tip is not on the subject of using a TTS converter itself, but on the tool, you use in order to create your final project! For that, we recommend <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>.</p>

<p>Text-to-Speech is an ingenious accessibility invention that has only grown more and more popular as AI has been thrown in the mix — making the converted speech sound more natural than ever!</p>
<p>As requested, in this article, we’ll be focusing on the subject of <strong>converting text to MP3</strong> format (or, rather, a tangible file that you can use for projects!)</p>

Text-to-Speech, also called TTS, as previously mentioned, is an accessibility invention. It was developed to help those with vision impairment or blindness — giving them the ability to have text read to them out loud to them (without requiring someone specifically read it out loud for them.</p>
<p>More recent development in TTS technology has allowed it to grow more useful outside of those parameters, however. Especially seeing as it is now possible to convert <strong>text to MP3 with natural voices</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="01Why-Use-Text-to-Speech-Converter-2"><a href="#01Why-Use-Text-to-Speech-Converter-2" class="headerlink" title="01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?"></a>01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?</h3><p><strong>Text-to-Speech human voice converter</strong>s are popular with content creators, and thus, they are the ones who see the most use for them (in the commercial sense). After all, it’s easy enough to convert already created content (in the form of text) into an audio file that there’s no reason not to! Especially since it means that more people would have access to their content!</p>

Getting a live voice actor to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> for you is very expensive — since you’re paying not only for the voice-actors hours spent but also the use of the expensive equipment that they use for creating voiceovers.</p>
<p>In that regard, even PAID text-to-speech converters are easier on the budget. Making it the perfect solution for content creators who want to increase the accessibility of their content but do not have the time (to create the voiceovers themselves) or the money (to hire someone else to record it).</p>

And, depending on what you’re looking for, you might find yourself longing for extra features later on down the line. That is why, when looking to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> we recommend considering the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Converting Time</strong>: How fast does the converter work? Most text-to-speech converters work almost instantaneously! So, if the one you’re using currently is slow? It might be best to give it a pass over to the next candidate.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Sound Quality</strong>: You should also test out whether or not the sound quality of the converted text to speech is good.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Multi-Language Support</strong>: Since this is all for the sake of increasing accessibility, you should start thinking about how many languages your converter supports as well. You might not be able to use all of them or even want to. But, that extra function can be helpful for the future.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Voice-Control Options</strong>: Does the converter offers you advanced voice controls? Your average converter usually offers speed and voice options, but you might find that a text-to-speech converter with more advanced options (i.e., tone, pitch, etc. controls) may help you get better quality content in the long run.</p>

Most <strong>text-to-human voice converter</strong>s function much the same way. The main difference usually being on the number of features focused and the limitations imposed (for tools with FREEmium services that impose limits on the FREE version, like the tool we’ll be using for our example):</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Upload Text</strong></p>
<p>First, upload the text that you want to convert into speech!</p>
<p>Most online converters offer a text box that you can use in order to copy &amp; paste the text onto (like in the image below), while others offer an ‘upload’ feature that you can use to upload text from a document.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Adjust Voice Reader!</strong></p>
<p>Next, the main thing that you usually have to worry about is the voice options.</p>
<p>Most TTS converters at least offer the opportunity to choose what voice you want the text to be read in. Some, more advanced solutions, may offer voices in other languages, dialects, accents, etc. as well as voice control options (tone, pitch, etc.)</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Reader Controls!</strong></p>
<p>Outside of voice options, most text-to-speech converters also offer the ability to control the general outcome of the converted text to speech.</p>
<p>More advanced tools will have multiple options on offer for this, but even the most basic ones at least offer a method for controlling the speed at which the text is read by the voice you’ve chosen!</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Convert Text to MP3!</strong></p>
<p>Now is finally the time to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> format! Some TTS readers will not allow for this without you paying the premium price, but most will at least offer a limited MP3 conversion feature (usually one that limits the length of conversion or the quality).</p>

In this next part, we’ll be focusing on “super tips”</p>
<p>OR, tips that allow you to generally make the most of these <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> to the fullest!</p>
<p><strong>Tip 1: Use AI Text-to-Speech!</strong></p>
<p>Our first tip is to encourage you to take full advantage of AI text-to-speech functions. Artificial Intelligence allows the converted text to sound much nicer and much more like it was read by an actual human being — which enables you to create a very professional-sounding project without having to hire a voiceover actor&#x2F;actress.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-9.png"
                      alt="Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Text-to-Speech"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 2: Language and Regions Settings!</strong></p>
<p>If your content is available in multiple languages and you want to convert all of the different editions of said content, you’ll need to find a converter that supports all of those languages. You may also consider looking for regional support as well. For example, for basic English language, most TTS converters usually have “American” voices as well as “British” voices to support different accents despite them using the same text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-10.png"
                      alt="Language and Regions Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 3: Pick an Appropriate Voice!</strong></p>
<p>The voice you choose to read your text is also very important. Some premium <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> offer a great variety to choose from to give you options when it comes to what kind of voice you want to read your content.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-11.png"
                      alt="TTS Voices Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Audio Settings!</strong></p>
<p>This is a bit of a rare feature, but some TTS converters will allow you to adjust your audio before it converts your <strong>content from text to speech (MP3)</strong>. Sometimes, this is as simple as allowing you to choose an audio format (as is shown in the image below), other times, it allows you to control the actual sound quality of the finished product.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-12.png"
                      alt="TTS Audio Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 5: Adjust Voice Speed!</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, we emphasized the importance of choosing your voice reader carefully! Now, we focus on the subject of speed. Some voices are better when they are slowed down, others are better when sped up. Play around with these settings to see which way is more natural for your chosen voice!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-13.png"
                      alt="TTS Voice Speed Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 6: Adjust Voice Pitch</strong></p>
<p>To allow for even more flexibility when it comes to voice style, you’ll find that some TTS converters will allow you to adjust voice pitch! This is a helpful feature for when you’re looking for that particular voice type, as it will allow you to experiment more with the kind of sound you want your content to be known for.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Voice Pitch Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 7: Voice Effects Options!</strong></p>
<p>Another advanced feature that you might run into (and should definitely take advantage of), is voice effects! This, again, will allow you to fully customize the type of voice that your content is known for. It’s also great for when you’re aiming for a more natural sound (if you’re patient enough in order to take full advantage of it!)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Voice Effects Options"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 8: Use Advanced Video Editing!</strong></p>
<p>Our last tip is not on the subject of using a TTS converter itself, but on the tool, you use in order to create your final project! For that, we recommend <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>.</p>

<p>Text-to-Speech is an ingenious accessibility invention that has only grown more and more popular as AI has been thrown in the mix — making the converted speech sound more natural than ever!</p>
<p>As requested, in this article, we’ll be focusing on the subject of <strong>converting text to MP3</strong> format (or, rather, a tangible file that you can use for projects!)</p>

Text-to-Speech, also called TTS, as previously mentioned, is an accessibility invention. It was developed to help those with vision impairment or blindness — giving them the ability to have text read to them out loud to them (without requiring someone specifically read it out loud for them.</p>
<p>More recent development in TTS technology has allowed it to grow more useful outside of those parameters, however. Especially seeing as it is now possible to convert <strong>text to MP3 with natural voices</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="01Why-Use-Text-to-Speech-Converter-3"><a href="#01Why-Use-Text-to-Speech-Converter-3" class="headerlink" title="01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?"></a>01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?</h3><p><strong>Text-to-Speech human voice converter</strong>s are popular with content creators, and thus, they are the ones who see the most use for them (in the commercial sense). After all, it’s easy enough to convert already created content (in the form of text) into an audio file that there’s no reason not to! Especially since it means that more people would have access to their content!</p>

Getting a live voice actor to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> for you is very expensive — since you’re paying not only for the voice-actors hours spent but also the use of the expensive equipment that they use for creating voiceovers.</p>
<p>In that regard, even PAID text-to-speech converters are easier on the budget. Making it the perfect solution for content creators who want to increase the accessibility of their content but do not have the time (to create the voiceovers themselves) or the money (to hire someone else to record it).</p>

And, depending on what you’re looking for, you might find yourself longing for extra features later on down the line. That is why, when looking to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> we recommend considering the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Converting Time</strong>: How fast does the converter work? Most text-to-speech converters work almost instantaneously! So, if the one you’re using currently is slow? It might be best to give it a pass over to the next candidate.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Sound Quality</strong>: You should also test out whether or not the sound quality of the converted text to speech is good.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Multi-Language Support</strong>: Since this is all for the sake of increasing accessibility, you should start thinking about how many languages your converter supports as well. You might not be able to use all of them or even want to. But, that extra function can be helpful for the future.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Voice-Control Options</strong>: Does the converter offers you advanced voice controls? Your average converter usually offers speed and voice options, but you might find that a text-to-speech converter with more advanced options (i.e., tone, pitch, etc. controls) may help you get better quality content in the long run.</p>

Specifically, a FREEmium text-to-speech converter that you can use when you’re still on the trying-out stage! This part will include a tutorial and a short introduction:</p>
<h3 id="014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited-3"><a href="#014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited-3" class="headerlink" title="014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?"></a>014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?</h3><p>First, for the promised tutorial! Most <strong>text-to-human voice converter</strong>s function much the same way. The main difference usually being on the number of features focused and the limitations imposed (for tools with FREEmium services that impose limits on the FREE version, like the tool we’ll be using for our example):</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Upload Text</strong></p>
<p>First, upload the text that you want to convert into speech!</p>
<p>Most online converters offer a text box that you can use in order to copy &amp; paste the text onto (like in the image below), while others offer an ‘upload’ feature that you can use to upload text from a document.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload or Copy &amp; Paste Text"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Adjust Voice Reader!</strong></p>
<p>Next, the main thing that you usually have to worry about is the voice options.</p>
<p>Most TTS converters at least offer the opportunity to choose what voice you want the text to be read in. Some, more advanced solutions, may offer voices in other languages, dialects, accents, etc. as well as voice control options (tone, pitch, etc.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Set Voice Reader"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Reader Controls!</strong></p>
<p>Outside of voice options, most text-to-speech converters also offer the ability to control the general outcome of the converted text to speech.</p>
<p>More advanced tools will have multiple options on offer for this, but even the most basic ones at least offer a method for controlling the speed at which the text is read by the voice you’ve chosen!</p>

                     lazyload

                      alt="Adjust Speech Controls"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Convert Text to MP3!</strong></p>
<p>Now is finally the time to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> format! Some TTS readers will not allow for this without you paying the premium price, but most will at least offer a limited MP3 conversion feature (usually one that limits the length of conversion or the quality).</p>

In this next part, we’ll be focusing on “super tips”</p>
<p>OR, tips that allow you to generally make the most of these <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> to the fullest!</p>
<p><strong>Tip 1: Use AI Text-to-Speech!</strong></p>
<p>Our first tip is to encourage you to take full advantage of AI text-to-speech functions. Artificial Intelligence allows the converted text to sound much nicer and much more like it was read by an actual human being — which enables you to create a very professional-sounding project without having to hire a voiceover actor&#x2F;actress.</p>

                      alt="Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Text-to-Speech"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 2: Language and Regions Settings!</strong></p>
<p>If your content is available in multiple languages and you want to convert all of the different editions of said content, you’ll need to find a converter that supports all of those languages. You may also consider looking for regional support as well. For example, for basic English language, most TTS converters usually have “American” voices as well as “British” voices to support different accents despite them using the same text.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Language and Regions Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 3: Pick an Appropriate Voice!</strong></p>
<p>The voice you choose to read your text is also very important. Some premium <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> offer a great variety to choose from to give you options when it comes to what kind of voice you want to read your content.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="TTS Voices Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Audio Settings!</strong></p>
<p>This is a bit of a rare feature, but some TTS converters will allow you to adjust your audio before it converts your <strong>content from text to speech (MP3)</strong>. Sometimes, this is as simple as allowing you to choose an audio format (as is shown in the image below), other times, it allows you to control the actual sound quality of the finished product.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="TTS Audio Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 5: Adjust Voice Speed!</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, we emphasized the importance of choosing your voice reader carefully! Now, we focus on the subject of speed. Some voices are better when they are slowed down, others are better when sped up. Play around with these settings to see which way is more natural for your chosen voice!</p>

                     lazyload

                      alt="TTS Voice Speed Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 6: Adjust Voice Pitch</strong></p>
<p>To allow for even more flexibility when it comes to voice style, you’ll find that some TTS converters will allow you to adjust voice pitch! This is a helpful feature for when you’re looking for that particular voice type, as it will allow you to experiment more with the kind of sound you want your content to be known for.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Voice Pitch Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 7: Voice Effects Options!</strong></p>
<p>Another advanced feature that you might run into (and should definitely take advantage of), is voice effects! This, again, will allow you to fully customize the type of voice that your content is known for. It’s also great for when you’re aiming for a more natural sound (if you’re patient enough in order to take full advantage of it!)</p>

                      alt="Voice Effects Options"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 8: Use Advanced Video Editing!</strong></p>
<p>Our last tip is not on the subject of using a TTS converter itself, but on the tool, you use in order to create your final project! For that, we recommend <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>.</p>
<p>Filmora is a content creation tool that will allow you to expand your video editing capabilities with little to no effort. It’s highly intuitive and thus incredibly very easy to use — allowing you to create and perfect your content efficiently! It’s also, in this case, very good at ensuring that you can make full use of your carefully curated TTS MP3!</p>

<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-3"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-3" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> Text-to-Speech has only continued to grow popular with content creators as the technology of it improves — allowing for more natural sounding voices and endless customizations.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Most of these text-to-speech converters work in much the same way. All you need to do is upload the text you want to convert, adjust the voice and sound settings as needed, and you’re done!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Of course, there are some extra little tidbits that you might also want to know in order to enhance your converted text. Our general advice for that is to experiment to the fullest and make sure that you finish everything up with a high-quality video editor like Filmora to ensure that your finished project is as near to perfect as possible!</p>

<p>It has been some time since Microsoft stopped all support for Windows 7, which left PC users without the<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >iMovie equivalent Windows Movie Maker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Moreover, Windows 10 doesn’t have a built-in app that is dedicated solely to video editing.</p>
<p>However, you shouldn’t panic if you are looking for <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editing software for Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> since there are plenty of free and affordable options to choose from. In fact, finding an app you can use to polish your videos on PC computers, shouldn’t be too difficult even if you have no previous video editing experience.</p>
<p>That is why in this article we are going to take you through some of the best iMovie replacements for Windows 10 you can use to create stunning videos that are going to attract the attention of your online audience.</p>
<h2 id="Top-5-iMovie-Replacements-for-Windows-10-Free-Paid"><a href="#Top-5-iMovie-Replacements-for-Windows-10-Free-Paid" class="headerlink" title="Top 5 iMovie Replacements for Windows 10 [Free &amp; Paid]"></a>Top 5 iMovie Replacements for Windows 10 [Free &amp; Paid]</h2><p>iMovie isn’t designed to perform demanding video editing tasks, which is the reason why we selected the video editing software products that are aimed at newcomers to the video editing world. So let’s take a look at some of the best video editing apps for Windows 10 you can use as a replacement for iMovie.</p>
<h3 id="1-Windows-10-Photos-App"><a href="#1-Windows-10-Photos-App" class="headerlink" title="1. Windows 10 Photos App"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-photos/9wzdncrfjbh4?activetab=pivot:overviewtab" >Windows 10 Photos App <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>The Photos app is the only built-in app on Windows 10 that offers video editing features. Even though the app is designed to help PC users view, organize and edit photos, you can still use it to perform basic video editing tasks.</p>
<p>You can either choose to start working on a new project from scratch or to create a video automatically. In case you decide to make a video automatically, you just have to select the footage, name your project and wait for the Photos App to generate a new video for you.</p>
<p>Opting to edit your footage manually will enable you to trim or split video clips, alter their playback speed and apply filters to the footage. Optionally, you can also add text layers to your videos, use motion effects to simulate camera movement, or use some available 3D filters. Exporting projects in resolutions higher than 1080p or uploading your videos directly to social media from the Photos app isn’t an option.</p>

Creating the opening titles, enhancing the colors in video clips, applying filters and image overlays are just a few among the countless video editing options Filmora provides.</p>
<p>What’s more, the video editor is equipped with a music library that contains a selection of royalty-free songs, which enables you to create a soundtrack even if you don’t have the music you can use in your videos. You can export all your projects to your accounts on Vimeo or YouTube directly from Filmora, but you should keep in mind that all videos created with the free version of this video editor are going to be watermarked.</p>

However, the Adobe Rush app that is compatible with desktops and Smartphones is easy to use, and it enables you to edit even while you are on the go.</p>
<p>Adobe Rush enables you to capture and edit your footage from one place, and it stores all your projects on the cloud so that you can open them with Adobe Premiere Pro if you want to perform advanced video editing tasks.</p>
<p>The app offers instructions at every step of the video editing process, which means that you don’t need any previous video editing experience to create a new video with Adobe Rush. Moreover, sharing the videos you edit with this app on Instagram, Facebook or other social media platforms won’t take much more than a few moments of your time.</p>

Moreover, the editor you choose has to offer support for the file format or the resolution in which the video was captured. Here are some of the most important factors you need to consider before installing a new video editor on your computer.</p>
<h3 id="1-4K-Video-Editing-Support"><a href="#1-4K-Video-Editing-Support" class="headerlink" title="1. 4K Video Editing Support"></a>1. 4K Video Editing Support</h3><p>Recording videos in 4K resolution has become more popular in recent years, as Smartphones and action cameras started offering this option. So if you are recording 4K videos often, you need video editing software that enables you to edit the videos recorded in this resolution. Moreover, you need to make sure that the video editing app you’re interested in allows you to export projects in 4K resolution.</p>
<h3 id="2-Cross-device-Capability"><a href="#2-Cross-device-Capability" class="headerlink" title="2. Cross-device Capability"></a>2. Cross-device Capability</h3><p>Social media content creators often want to share their videos just moments after recording it. So, if you are often creating videos you share on social media, you should choose a video editor that is also compatible with iPhones and Android devices. Having the option to edit videos from both your Smartphone and your computer will make it much easier to share fresh content on social media.</p>
<h3 id="3-Built-in-Features-Resource"><a href="#3-Built-in-Features-Resource" class="headerlink" title="3. Built-in Features &amp; Resource"></a>3. Built-in Features &amp; Resource</h3><p>The number of video editing tools, the sizes of audio and video effects libraries, or how many transitions a video editing software offers are all the factors you need to consider before you opt for one option or the other. On the other hand, getting a video editing app for Windows 10 that offers advanced video editing tools is only a good option if you are planning to learn how to use these tools.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-4"><a href="#Conclusion-4" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Even though Windows 10 no longer has an iMovie equivalent, it is still relatively easy to find a video editing app for Windows 10 you can use to edit your footage quickly before sharing it with your friends on social media.</p>
<p>You don’t need to have a ton of video editing experience in order to create videos with video editors like Filmora or Adobe Rush. Which iMovie replacement are you going to choose? Leave a comment and let us know.</p>

<p>However, you shouldn’t panic if you are looking for <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editing software for Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> since there are plenty of free and affordable options to choose from. In fact, finding an app you can use to polish your videos on PC computers, shouldn’t be too difficult even if you have no previous video editing experience.</p>
<p>That is why in this article we are going to take you through some of the best iMovie replacements for Windows 10 you can use to create stunning videos that are going to attract the attention of your online audience.</p>

So let’s take a look at some of the best video editing apps for Windows 10 you can use as a replacement for iMovie.</p>
<h3 id="1-Windows-10-Photos-App-1"><a href="#1-Windows-10-Photos-App-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

Even though the app is designed to help PC users view, organize and edit photos, you can still use it to perform basic video editing tasks.</p>
<p>You can either choose to start working on a new project from scratch or to create a video automatically. In case you decide to make a video automatically, you just have to select the footage, name your project and wait for the Photos App to generate a new video for you.</p>
<p>Opting to edit your footage manually will enable you to trim or split video clips, alter their playback speed and apply filters to the footage. Optionally, you can also add text layers to your videos, use motion effects to simulate camera movement, or use some available 3D filters. Exporting projects in resolutions higher than 1080p or uploading your videos directly to social media from the Photos app isn’t an option.</p>

<p>Wondershare’s video editor provides support for 4K videos, and it is compatible with almost all commonly used video file formats.

<p>What’s more, the video editor is equipped with a music library that contains a selection of royalty-free songs, which enables you to create a soundtrack even if you don’t have the music you can use in your videos. You can export all your projects to your accounts on Vimeo or YouTube directly from Filmora, but you should keep in mind that all videos created with the free version of this video editor are going to be watermarked.</p>

<p>It has been some time since Microsoft stopped all support for Windows 7, which left PC users without the<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >iMovie equivalent Windows Movie Maker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Moreover, Windows 10 doesn’t have a built-in app that is dedicated solely to video editing.</p>
<p>However, you shouldn’t panic if you are looking for <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editing software for Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> since there are plenty of free and affordable options to choose from. In fact, finding an app you can use to polish your videos on PC computers, shouldn’t be too difficult even if you have no previous video editing experience.</p>
<p>That is why in this article we are going to take you through some of the best iMovie replacements for Windows 10 you can use to create stunning videos that are going to attract the attention of your online audience.</p>
<h2 id="Top-5-iMovie-Replacements-for-Windows-10-Free-Paid-3"><a href="#Top-5-iMovie-Replacements-for-Windows-10-Free-Paid-3" class="headerlink" title="Top 5 iMovie Replacements for Windows 10 [Free &amp; Paid]"></a>Top 5 iMovie Replacements for Windows 10 [Free &amp; Paid]</h2><p>iMovie isn’t designed to perform demanding video editing tasks, which is the reason why we selected the video editing software products that are aimed at newcomers to the video editing world. So let’s take a look at some of the best video editing apps for Windows 10 you can use as a replacement for iMovie.</p>
<h3 id="1-Windows-10-Photos-App-3"><a href="#1-Windows-10-Photos-App-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Windows 10 Photos App"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-photos/9wzdncrfjbh4?activetab=pivot:overviewtab" >Windows 10 Photos App <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>The Photos app is the only built-in app on Windows 10 that offers video editing features. Even though the app is designed to help PC users view, organize and edit photos, you can still use it to perform basic video editing tasks.</p>
<p>You can either choose to start working on a new project from scratch or to create a video automatically. In case you decide to make a video automatically, you just have to select the footage, name your project and wait for the Photos App to generate a new video for you.</p>
<p>Opting to edit your footage manually will enable you to trim or split video clips, alter their playback speed and apply filters to the footage. Optionally, you can also add text layers to your videos, use motion effects to simulate camera movement, or use some available 3D filters. Exporting projects in resolutions higher than 1080p or uploading your videos directly to social media from the Photos app isn’t an option.</p>

<h3 id="2-Wondershare-Filmora-3"><a href="#2-Wondershare-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Wondershare Filmora"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>If you are looking for a video editing app for Windows 10 that enables you to edit the videos recorded with action cameras, Smartphones, or DSLRs, then Filmora is probably one of your best options.</p>
<p>Wondershare’s video editor provides support for 4K videos, and it is compatible with almost all commonly used video file formats. Starting a new project or importing the footage into Filmora is a straightforward process that requires a minimum amount of effort. Creating the opening titles, enhancing the colors in video clips, applying filters and image overlays are just a few among the countless video editing options Filmora provides.</p>
<p>What’s more, the video editor is equipped with a music library that contains a selection of royalty-free songs, which enables you to create a soundtrack even if you don’t have the music you can use in your videos. You can export all your projects to your accounts on Vimeo or YouTube directly from Filmora, but you should keep in mind that all videos created with the free version of this video editor are going to be watermarked.</p>

<h3 id="3-Adobe-Rush-3"><a href="#3-Adobe-Rush-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

However, the Adobe Rush app that is compatible with desktops and Smartphones is easy to use, and it enables you to edit even while you are on the go.</p>
<p>Adobe Rush enables you to capture and edit your footage from one place, and it stores all your projects on the cloud so that you can open them with Adobe Premiere Pro if you want to perform advanced video editing tasks.</p>
<p>The app offers instructions at every step of the video editing process, which means that you don’t need any previous video editing experience to create a new video with Adobe Rush. Moreover, sharing the videos you edit with this app on Instagram, Facebook or other social media platforms won’t take much more than a few moments of your time.</p>

<p>You can use Shotcut to detach audio from video, set keyframes, or cut and trim each clip you add to the editor’s timeline. This video editing software features a rich library of transitions, which enables you to avoid hard cuts in your videos.</p>
<p>Moreover, Shotcut has all the tools you’re going to need in order to fine-tune the colors in each clip you want to include in the final cut of your video. The software’s audio editing capabilities are equally impressive, you can easily fade in and fade out audio files, control their volume or apply filters to them. The best part is that Shotcut doesn’t have demanding system requirements, so you can use it on computers that don’t have a lot of processing power or powerful graphics cards.</p>

Moreover, this video editing software grants you access to advanced motion tracking options, chroma key visual effects, and a variety of powerful video editing features that can help you create videos that are going to stand out on social media.</p>
<p>However, you need at least 4 GB of RAM as well as 7 GB of free space on your PC’s hard drive in order to use PowerDirector. Even so, the software has CPU and GPU performance-boosting technology that is compatible with Nvidia, AMD Radeon, Ryzen and Intel graphics cards.</p>
